#### **Dr. Firas Moosvi**

Firas Moosvi is a Lecturer at UBC Okanagan in the Computer Science, Math, Physics, and Statistics department.
He teaches courses in Physics, Data Science, and Computer Science at the undergraduate and graduate levels.
He has many research interests and they fall under three main umbrellas: medical imaging for applications in cancer, scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL), and learning analytics.
Most recently, he is looking at how the field of learning analytics can provide insight to surface and reduce inequities in STEM programs.
Firas has a deep appreciation for data visualization, active learning, and open source projects.<br><br><br>

#### **Ava Cornell**

I am a fourth year honours physics student at UBC Okanagan. Throughout my degree, I have thoroughly enjoyed being a physics teaching assistant and tutor, which has caused me to develop an interest in making learning more accessible and less stressful for students. In my free time, I like to hike, camp, and socialize. <br><br><br>

#### **Abby Kiehlbauch**

I am a first year Bachelor of Arts student at UBCO planning to major in Computer Science. As it is my first year I don't have a specific area of interest, however my passions have always been mental health advocacy and social justice - I hope to find a way in which Computer Science can elevate those two fields. I am looking forward to further exploring the field of Computer Science in my next three years at UBCO. While I'm not studying or spending my days on Zoom I am usually reading, sewing, crocheting, or baking! <br><br><br>

### Graduate students

#### **Michael Kudla**

I am a PhD student in MedPhys. I am developing a patient specific technology suite for low cost imaging and surgical tool manufacturing (3D printed) for treatment of gynecological malignancies. I am into rock climbing and ski-touring. <br><br><br>
