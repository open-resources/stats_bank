      part1:
        ans1:
          value: 'False'
          feedback: Correct!
        ans2:
          value: 'True'
          feedback: The entire confidence interval is above 0.
      part2:
        ans1:
          value: 'True'
          feedback: The lower bound is negative, which contradicts the claim that
            the male proportion is higher.
        ans2:
          value: 'False'
          feedback: The lower bound is negative, which contradicts the claim that
            the male proportion is higher.
      part3:
        ans1:

# {{ params.vars.title }}
A study asked {{ params.male_sample_size }} male and {{ params.female_sample_size }} female undergraduate college students their favorite color. A 95% confidence interval for the difference between the proportions of males and females whose favorite color is black $(p\_{male} - p\_{female})$ was calculated to be ({{ params.lower_bound }}, {{ params.upper_bound }}).
Based on this information, determine if the following statements about undergraduate college students are true or false.

## Part 1

We are 95% confident that the true proportion of males whose favorite color is black is {{ params.lower_bound_percent_abs }}% lower to {{ params.upper_bound_percent_abs }}% higher than the true proportion of females whose favorite color is black.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans2.value }}

## Part 2

We are 95% confident that the true proportion of males whose favorite color is black is {{ params.lower_bound_percent_abs_p2 }}% to {{ params.upper_bound_percent_abs_p2 }}% higher than the true proportion of females whose favorite color is black.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part2.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans2.value }}

## Part 3

95% of random samples will produce 95% confidence intervals that include the true difference between the population proportions of males and females whose favorite color is black.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part3.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part3.ans2.value }}

## Part 4

We can conclude that there is a significant difference between the proportions of males and females whose favorite color is black and that the difference between the two sample proportions is too large to plausibly be due to chance.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part4.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans2.value }}

## Part 5

The 95% confidence interval for $(p\_{female} - p\_{male})$ cannot be calculated with only the information given in this exercise.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part5.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part5.ans2.value }}
