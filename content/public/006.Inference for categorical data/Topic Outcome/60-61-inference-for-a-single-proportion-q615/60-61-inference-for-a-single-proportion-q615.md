# {{ params.vars.title }}
A Kaiser Family Foundation poll for US adults in 2019 reported varying levels of support for a generic "National Health Plan" among different political affiliations. For Independents, it was found that approximately {{ params.vars.p_hat_percent }}% supported the plan.

There were various sample sizes for each group, but for this problem, we are focusing on the responses from the Independents.

## Part 1

If we wanted to estimate this number to within {{ params.vars.margin_of_error_percent }}% with {{ params.vars.confidence }}% confidence, what would be an appropriate sample size?
