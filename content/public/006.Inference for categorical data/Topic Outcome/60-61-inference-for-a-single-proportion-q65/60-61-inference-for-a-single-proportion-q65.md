        title: Gender equality
        sample_size: 1944
        proportion: 22.0
        margin_of_error: 1.84
        lower_bound: 20.16
        upper_bound: 23.84
        margin_of_error_part4: 0.921
        selected_option1: If we considered many random samples of 1944 Americans,
          and we calculated 95% confidence intervals for each, 95% of these intervals
          would include the true population proportion of Americans who think it's
          the government's responsibility to promote equality between men and women.
        selected_option2: Doubling the sample size will halve the margin of error,
          regardless of the initial sample size and confidence level.

# {{ params.vars.title }}
The General Social Survey asked a random sample of {{ params.vars.sample_size }} Americans the following question: "On the whole, do you think it should or should not be the government's responsibility to promote equality between men and women?" {{ params.vars.proportion }}% of the respondents said it "should be". At a 95% confidence level, this sample has {{ params.vars.margin_of_error }}% margin of error. Based on this information, determine if the following statements are true or false.

## Part 1

We are 95% confident that between {{ params.vars.lower_bound }}% and {{ params.vars.upper_bound }}% of Americans in this sample think it's the government's responsibility to promote equality between men and women.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans2.value }}

## Part 2

We are 95% confident that between {{ params.vars.lower_bound }}% and {{ params.vars.upper_bound }}% of all Americans think it's the government's responsibility to promote equality between men and women.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part2.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans2.value }}

## Part 3

{{ params.vars.selected_option1 }}

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part3.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part3.ans2.value }}

## Part 4

{{ params.vars.selected_option2 }}

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part4.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans2.value }}

## Part 5

Based on this confidence interval, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that a majority of Americans think it's the government's responsibility to promote equality between men and women.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part5.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part5.ans2.value }}
