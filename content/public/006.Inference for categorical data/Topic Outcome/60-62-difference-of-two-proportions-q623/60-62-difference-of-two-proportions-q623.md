        ans1:
          value: Since the p-value is very large, we reject $H_0$. The data provide
            weak evidence that the proportion of college graduates who do not have
            an opinion on this issue is different than that of non-college graduates.

        ans2:
          value: Since the p-value is very small, we accept $H_0$. The data provide
            strong evidence that the proportion of college graduates who do not have
            an opinion on this issue is the same as that of non-college graduates.

          feedback: Correct!
        ans4:
          value: Since the p-value > 0.05, we fail to reject $H_0$. The data do not
            provide strong evidence that the proportion of college graduates who do
            not have an opinion on this issue is different from that of non-college
            graduates.

# {{ params.vars.title }}
A survey asked {{ params.total }} randomly sampled registered voters in California "Do you support? Or do you oppose? Drilling for oil and natural gas off the Coast of California? Or do you not know enough to say?" Below is the distribution of responses, separated based on whether or not the respondent graduated from college.

|                 |        **College Grad**      |                              |
|-----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
|                 |         **Yes**              |            **No**            |
|-----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Support**     | {{ params.yes_support }}| {{ params.no_support }} |
| **Oppose**      | {{ params.yes_oppose }} | {{ params.no_oppose }}  |
| **Do not know** | {{ params.yes_do_not_know }} | {{ params.no_do_not_know }} |
|-----------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|  **Total**      |  {{ params.yes_total }}      |   {{ params.no_total }}     |

## Part 1

What percent of college graduates in this sample do not know enough to have an opinion on drilling for oil and natural gas off the Coast of California?

### Answer Section

Enter in a numeric value

## Part 2

What percent of non-college graduates in this sample do not know enough to have an opinion on drilling for oil and natural gas off the Coast of California?

### Answer Section

Enter in a numeric value

## Part 3

Let $p\_{CG}$ and $p\_{NCG}$ represent the proportion of college graduates and non-college graduates who responded "do not know". Formulate the null and alternative hypothesis.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part3.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part3.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part3.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part3.ans4.value }}

## Part 4

Is the independence condition being satisfied?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part4.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans2.value }}

## Part 5

Calculate the pooled proportion.

### Answer Section

Enter in a numeric value

## Part 6

Considering the pooled proportion, has the success-failure condition been satisfied?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part6.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part6.ans2.value }}

## Part 7

Calculate the test statistic.

### Answer Section

Enter in a numeric value

## Part 8

Determine the p-value from the calculated test statistic.

### Answer Section

Enter in a numeric value

## Part 9

Based on the p-value and a significance level of 0.05, state whether you will reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis and explain the conclusion.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part9.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part9.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part9.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part9.ans4.value }}
