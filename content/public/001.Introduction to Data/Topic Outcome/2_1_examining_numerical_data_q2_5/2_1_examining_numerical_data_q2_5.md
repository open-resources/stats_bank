      question1: American households spent an average of about $51 in 2007 on Halloween
        merchandise such as costumes, decorations and candy. To see if this number
        had changed, researchers conducted a new survey in 2008 before industry numbers
        were reported. The survey included 1400 households and found that average
        Halloween spending was $57 per household.
