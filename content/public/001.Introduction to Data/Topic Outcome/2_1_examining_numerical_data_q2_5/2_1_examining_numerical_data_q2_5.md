        option2:
          value: 2008
        option3:
          value: 1600
        statement1:
          value: Claimed population mean
          matches: '53'
        statement2:
          value: Sample mean
          matches: '56'
      question1: American households spent an average of about $53 in 2007 on Halloween
        merchandise such as costumes, decorations and candy. To see if this number
        had changed, researchers conducted a new survey in 2008 before industry numbers
        were reported. The survey included 1600 households and found that average
        Halloween spending was $56 per household.
