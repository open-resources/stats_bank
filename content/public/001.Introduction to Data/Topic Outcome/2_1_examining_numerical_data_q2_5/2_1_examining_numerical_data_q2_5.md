    params_question1: American households spent an average of about $52 in 2007 on
      Halloween merchandise such as costumes, decorations and candy. To see if this
      number had changed, researchers conducted a new survey in 2008 before industry
      numbers were reported. The survey included 1200 households and found that average
      Halloween spending was $60 per household.
