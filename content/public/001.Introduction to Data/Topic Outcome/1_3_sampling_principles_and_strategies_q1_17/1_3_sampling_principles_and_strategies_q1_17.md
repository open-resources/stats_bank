# {{ params_vars_title }}
The General Social Survey asked the question, "After an average work day, about how many hours do you have to relax or pursue activities that you enjoy?" to a random sample of ${{ params_description_num1 }}$ Americans. The average relaxing time was found to be ${{ params_description_num2 }}$ hours. Determine which of the following is an observation, a variable, a sample statistic (value calculated based on the observed sample), or a population parameter.
