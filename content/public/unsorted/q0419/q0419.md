# {{ params_vars_title }}
About $70$% of 18-20 year olds consumed alcoholic beverages in any given year. We now consider a random sample of ${{params_n}}$ 18-20 year olds.

## Part 1

How many people would you expect to have consumed alcoholic beverages?

## Part 2

And with what standard deviation? Round to 2 decimal places.

## Part 3

Would you be surprised if there were ${{params_k}}$ or more people who have consumed alcoholic beverages? Explain with Z-score.

## Part 4

What is the probability that ${{params_k}}$ or more people in this sample have consumed alcoholic beverages?
Use normal approximation and 0.5 correction. Round to 4 decimal places.
