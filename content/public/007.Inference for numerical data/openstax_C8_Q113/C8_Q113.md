      part3:
        ans1:
          value: The sample should have been increased.
          feedback: Good job!
        ans2:
          value: The sample should have been decreased.
          feedback: Try again please!
        ans3:
          value: It is impossible to do this while maintaining the confidence level
            as same.
          feedback: Try again please!
        ans4:
          value: Increase the sample mean.
          feedback: Try again please! The sample mean has no direct impact on the
            margin of error.
        ans5:
          value: Use a larger significance level (alpha).
          feedback: Try again please! A larger alpha reduces the confidence level.
