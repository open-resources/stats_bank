## Part 1

A microbiologist is testing a water sample for E-coli. Suppose the null hypothesis, $H_0$, is: the sample does not contain E-coli. The probability that the sample does not contain E-coli, but the microbiologist thinks it does is ${{ params.alpha }}$. The probability that the sample does contain E-coli, but the microbiologist thinks it does not is ${{ params.beta }}$. What is the power of this test?
