# {{ params.vars.title }}
The Federal Election Commission (FEC) collects information about campaign contributions and disbursements for candidates and political committees each election cycle. A political action committee (PAC) is a committee formed to raise money for candidates and campaigns. A Leadership PAC is a PAC formed by a federal politician (senator or representative) to raise money to help other candidates' campaigns.
The FEC has reported financial information for {{params.total}} Leadership PACs that operating during a certain election cycle. The following table shows the total receipts during this cycle for a random selection of 30 Leadership PACs.

{{{params.table}}}

Given that:
$\bar{x} = {{ params.mean }}$ and $s = {{ params.std_dev }}$

Use this sample data to construct a {{params.confidence_level}}% confidence interval for the mean amount of money raised by all Leadership PACs during the specific election cycle. Use the Student's t-distribution.
