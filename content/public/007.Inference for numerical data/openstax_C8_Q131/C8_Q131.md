# {{ params.vars.title }}
A national survey of {{params.n}} adults was conducted by Rasmussen Reports. It concluded with 95% confidence that {{params.ci_95_lower}}% to {{params.ci_95_upper}}% of Americans believe that big-time college sports programs corrupt the process of higher education.

## Part 1

Find the point estimate for this confidence level.

### Answer Section

## Part 2

Find the margin of error for this confidence level.

### Answer Section

## Part 3

Can we (with 95% confidence) conclude that more than half of all American adults believe this?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part3.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part3.ans2.value }}

## Part 4

Use the point estimate from part a and n = {{params.n}} to calculate a {{params.confidence_level_low}}% confidence interval for the proportion of American adults that believe that major college sports programs corrupt higher education.

### Answer Section

## Part 5

Can we (with {{params.confidence_level_low}}% confidence) conclude that at least half of all American adults believe this?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part5.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part5.ans2.value }}
