      part1:
        ans1:
          value: For each observation in one data set, there is exactly one specially
            corresponding observation in the other data set for the same geographic
            location. The data are paired.
          feedback: Correct!
        ans2:
          value: The observations collected in 1948 and 2018 are completely independent
            of each other, with no relationship between the data sets. The data is
            unpaired.
          feedback: Incorrect!
        ans3:
          value: The data from 1948 and 2018 were collected using different methodologies
            and technologies, making direct comparisons inappropriate. The data is
            unpaired.
          feedback: Incorrect!
        ans4:
          value: Observations from 1948 are used as a control group, while the 2018
            data acts as the experimental group, implying a cause-and-effect relationship
            between the two years. The observations are therefore not paired but are
            part of a comparative study to measure the impact of time on temperature
            changes.
          feedback: Incorrect!
      part2:
        ans1:
          value: '$H_0: \mu_{2018} = \mu_{1948}$ (The average temperature in 2018
            is equal to the average temperature in 1948 at NOAA stations). $H_A: \mu_{2018}
            > \mu_{1948}$ (The average temperature in 2018 is higher than in 1948).'
          feedback: Incorrect!
        ans2:
          value: '$H_0: \mu_{2018} > \mu_{1948}$ (The average number of days exceeding
            90°F in 2018 is greater than in 1948 at NOAA stations). $H_A: \mu_{2018}
            \leq \mu_{1948}$ (The average number of days exceeding 90°F in 2018 is
            not greater than in 1948).'
          feedback: Incorrect!
        ans3:
          value: '$H_0: p_{2018} = 0.5$ (The proportion of days exceeding 90°F in
            2018 is 50%). $H_A: p_{2018} ≠ 0.5$ (The proportion of days exceeding
            90°F in 2018 is not 50%).'
          feedback: Incorrect!
        ans4:
          value: '$H_0: \mu_{diff} = 0$ (There is no difference in average number
            of days exceeding 90°F in 1948 and 2018 for NOAA stations). $H_A: \mu_{diff}
            ≠ 0$ (There is a difference).'
          feedback: Correct!
      part3:
        ans1:
          value: Locations were randomly sampled.
          feedback: Correct!
        ans2:
          value: Observations within pairs are independent.
          feedback: Correct!
        ans3:
          value: Sample size is adequate.
          feedback: Correct!
        ans4:
          value: Outliers are extreme.
          feedback: Incorrect!
        ans5:
          value: Observations within pairs are dependent.
          feedback: Incorrect!
      part6:
        ans1:
          value: Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject $H_0$. The data provide
            strong evidence that NOAA stations observed more 90°F days in 2018 than
            in 1948.
          feedback: Correct!
        ans2:
          value: Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject $H_0$.
            The data do not provide strong evidence that NOAA stations observed more
            90°F days in 2018 than in 1948.
          feedback: Incorrect!
      part7:
        ans1:
          value: Type 1 Error, since we may have incorrectly rejected $H_0$. This
            error would mean that NOAA stations did not actually observe a decrease,
            but the sample we took just so happened to make it appear that this was
            the case
          feedback: Correct!
        ans2:
          value: Type II Error, since we may have failed to reject $H_0$ incorrectly.
            This error would mean that NOAA stations did actually observe a decrease
            in the number of 90°F days in 2018 compared to 1948, but the sample we
            took was not able to provide enough evidence to demonstrate this decrease.
          feedback: Incorrect!
      part8:
        ans1:
          value: No, since we rejected $H_0$, which had a null value of 0.
          feedback: Correct!
        ans2:
          value: Yes, since we failed to reject $H_0$, which suggests the average
            difference between the number of days exceeding 90°F from 1948 and 2018
            might include 0.
          feedback: Incorrect!
      sample_size: 215
      mean_difference: 2.9
      std_deviation: 16.7

# {{ params.vars.title }}
Let's consider a limited set of climate data, examining temperature differences in 1948 vs 2018. We sampled {{ params.sample_size }} locations from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) historical data, where the data was available for both years of interest. We want to know: were there more days with temperatures exceeding 90°F in 2018 or in 1948? The difference in number of days exceeding 90°F (number of days in 2018 - number of days in 1948) was calculated for each of the {{ params.sample_size }} locations. The average of these differences was {{ params.mean_difference }} days with a standard deviation of {{ params.std_deviation }} days. We are interested in determining whether these data provide strong evidence that there were more days in 2018 that exceeded 90°F from NOAA’s weather stations.
