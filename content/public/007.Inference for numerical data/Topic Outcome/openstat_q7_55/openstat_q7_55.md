        ans1:
          value: 'Independence: it is a random sample, so we can assume that the students
            in this sample are independent of each other with respect to number of
            exclusive relationships they have been in.'
          feedback: Great! You got it.
        ans2:
          value: There are no students who have had no exclusive relationships in
            the sample, which suggests some student responses are likely missing
          feedback: Great! You got it.
        ans3:
          value: The sample size is at least 30, and there are no particularly extreme
            outliers, so the normality condition is reasonable.
          feedback: Great! You got it.
        ans4:
          value: We are $91$% confident that undergraduate students have been in (lower_interval)
            to (upper_interval) exclusive relationships, on average.
          feedback: Great! You got it.
        ans5:
          value: The sample size is at least 30, but there are extreme outliers, so
            the normality condition is unreasonable.
          feedback: Incorrect! Analyze the histogram again.
        ans6:
          value: We are $100$% certain that undergraduate students have been in (lower_interval)
            to (upper_interval) exclusive relationships, on average.
          feedback: Incorrect! This is not the correct way of expressing our confidence.

# {{ params.vars.title }}
A survey conducted on a reasonably random sample of ${{params.n}}$ undergraduates asked, among many other questions, about the number of exclusive relationships these students have been in. The histogram below shows the distribution of the data from this sample.The sample average is ${{params.sample_mean}}$ with a standard deviation of ${{params.sample_std}}$.

## Part 1

Estimate the confidence interval of exclusive relationships Duke students have been in using a ${{params.confidence_level}}$% confidence level.

Lower Interval:

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 2

Upper Interval:

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 3
