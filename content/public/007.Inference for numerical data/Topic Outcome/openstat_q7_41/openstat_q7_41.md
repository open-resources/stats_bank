          value: Since p-value $<$ 0.05, we reject $H_0$. The data provides convincing
            evidence of a difference between the average GPAs across three groups
            of majors.
          feedback: Try again! Check your calculations for p-value.
        ans2:
          value: Since p-value $>$ 0.05, fail to reject $H_0$. The data do not provide
            convincing evidence of a difference between the average GPAs across three
            groups of majors.
          feedback: Correct! You can observe this from the p-value you calculated
            in part 1.
        ans3:
          value: The data is insufficient to get the hypothesis test significance.
          feedback: Try calculating the p value since you have sufficient data to
            do this again!

# {{ params.vars.title }}
Undergraduate students taking an introductory statistics course at Duke University surveyed their GPA and major. The side-by-side box plots show the distribution of GPA among three groups of majors. Also provided is the ANOVA output.

{{{ params.table }}}

## Part 1

What is the p value of the hypothesis test?

### Answer Section

## Part 2

Using $H_0$: Average GPA is the same for all majors. $H_A$: At least one pair of means are different, what is the conclusion of the hypothesis test?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part2.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans3.value }}

## Part 3

How many students answered these questions on the survey, i.e. what is the sample size?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.
