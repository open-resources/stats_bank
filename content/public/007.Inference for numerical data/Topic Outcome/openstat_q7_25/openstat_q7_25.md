      part1:
        ans1:
          value: '$H_0 : μ_{6^{th}} = μ_{13^{th}}$. $H_A : μ_{6^{th}} > μ_{13^{th}}$'
          feedback: Incorrect!
        ans2:
          value: ' $H_0 : μ_{diff} = 0$. $H_A : μ_{diff} ≠ 0$'
          feedback: Correct!
        ans3:
          value: ' $H_0 : μ_{diff} > 0$. $H_A : μ_{diff} ≤ 0$'
          feedback: Incorrect!
        ans4:
          value: '$H_0 : μ_{6^{th}} = μ_{13^{th}}$. $H_A : μ_{6^{th}} = μ_{13^{th}}$'
          feedback: Incorrect!
      part4:
        ans1:
          value: The data suggest that there is no significant difference in the average
            number of traffic accident-related emergency room admissions between Friday
            the $6^{th}$ and Friday the $13^{th}$.
          feedback: Correct!
        ans2:
          value: The data provide strong evidence that the average number of traffic
            accident related emergency room admissions are different between Friday
            the $6^{th}$ and Friday the $13^{th}$.
          feedback: Incorrect!
        ans3:
          value: The results confirm with $100$% certainty that there are more accidents
            on Friday the $6^{th}$ compared to Friday the $13^{th}$.
          feedback: Incorrect!
        ans4:
          value: The data indicate that the number of accidents on Friday the $13^{th}$
            is significantly higher, proving the superstition about the day being
            unlucky.
          feedback: Incorrect!
      part7:
        ans1:
          value: Observational studies do not imply causation, and the difference
            observed does not necessarily mean increased risk for a responsible adult
            going out on Friday the $13^{th}$.
          feedback: Correct!
        ans2:
          value: The study conclusively proves that Friday the $13^{th}$ is an unlucky
            day with a consistent $52$% increase in the risk of transport accident-related
            hospital admissions.
          feedback: Incorrect!
        ans3:
          value: Scientific evidence from the study confirms that staying at home
            on Friday the $13^{th}$ will reduce the risk of transport accident-related
            hospital admissions.
          feedback: Incorrect!
        ans4:
          value: Observational studies like this one are not capable of providing
            any reliable information about risks, so the study's conclusion is not
            true.
          feedback: Incorrect!

# {{ params.vars.title }}
In the early 1990's, researchers in the UK collected data on traffic flow, number of shoppers, and traffic accident related emergency room admissions on Friday the $13^{th}$ and the previous Friday, Friday the $6^{th}$. The distributions of data on traffic accident related emergency room admissions from Friday the $6^{th}$ and Friday the $13^{th}$ are shown below for six such paired dates along with summary statistics. You may assume that conditions for inference are met.

{{{ params.table }}}

## Part 1

What are the hypotheses to evaluate if there is a difference between the average numbers of traffic accident related emergency room admissions between Friday the $6^{th}$ and Friday the $13^{th}$?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans4.value }}

## Part 2

Calculate the test statistic.

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 3

Calculate the p-value.

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 4

What is the conclusion of the hypothesis test?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part4.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans4.value }}

## Part 5

Calculate the lower bound of a $95$% confidence interval for the difference between the average numbers of traffic accident related emergency room admissions between Friday the $6^{th}$ and Friday the $13^{th}$.

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 6

Calculate the upper bound bound of a $95$% confidence interval for the difference between the average numbers of traffic accident related emergency room admissions between Friday the $6^{th}$ and Friday the $13^{th}$.

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 7

The conclusion of the original study states, "Friday $13^{th}$ is unlucky for some. The risk of hospital admission as a result of a transport accident may be increased by as much as $52$%. Staying at home is recommended." Do you agree with this statement? Explain your reasoning.
