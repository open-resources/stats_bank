        title: Air quality
      part1:
        ans1:
          value: Paired, because data are recorded in the same cities at two different
            time points, and the air quality in a city at one point is not independent
            of the air quality in the same city at another time point.
          feedback: Incorrect!
        ans2:
          value: Paired, because data are recorded in different cities at two different
            time points, and the air quality in a city at one point is independent
            of the air quality in another city at another time point.
          feedback: Incorrect!
        ans3:
          value: Non-paired, since air quality is influenced by many varying factors
            each year, making each year's data independent.
          feedback: Incorrect!
        ans4:
          value: Non-paired, because the measurements are from different, non-corresponding
            cities each year so, the air quality in a city at one point is independent
            of the air quality in another city at another time point.
          feedback: Correct!
      country_capitals: 27
      year_1: 2013
      year_2: 2017
      selected_scenario: but in a different set of cities

# {{ params.vars.title }}
Air quality measurements were collected in a random sample of ${{ params.country_capitals }}$ country capitals in ${{ params.year_1 }}$, and then again {{ params.selected_scenario }} in ${{ params.year_2 }}$. We would like to use these data to compare average air quality between the two years.

## Part 1

Should we use a paired or non-paired test? Explain your reasoning.
