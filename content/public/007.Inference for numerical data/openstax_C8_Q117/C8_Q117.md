        ans1:
          value: The minimum number will be increased.
          feedback: Good job! The critical value increases as the confidence level
            increases.
        ans2:
          value: The minimum number will be decreased.
          feedback: Try again please!
        ans3:
          value: The minimum number will be would be unaffected.

      selected: If it were later determined that it was important to use a higher
        confidence level and a new survey was commissioned, how would that affect
        the minimum number you would need to survey?

# {{ params.vars.title }}
Insurance companies are interested in knowing the population percent of drivers who always buckle up before riding in a car.

## Part 1

When designing a study to determine this population proportion, what is the minimum number you would need to survey to be {{params.confidence_level}}% confident that the population proportion is estimated to within {{params.margin_of_error}} margin of error?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 2

{{params.selected}}

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part3.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part3.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part3.ans3.value }}

## Part 3

If the insurance company sets a new standard at a 99% confidence level, what would be the new minimum number you would need to survey within {{params.margin_of_error}} margin of error?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.
