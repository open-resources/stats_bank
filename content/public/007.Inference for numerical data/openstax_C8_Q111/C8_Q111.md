# {{ params.vars.title }}
Unoccupied seats on flights cause airlines to lose revenue. Suppose a large airline wants to estimate its mean number of unoccupied seats per flight over the past year. To accomplish this, the records of {{params.sample_size}} flights are randomly selected and the number of unoccupied seats is noted for each of the sampled flights. The sample mean is {{params.mean}} seats and the sample standard deviation is {{params.std_dev}} seats.

## Part 1

Identify $\bar{x}$.

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 2

Identify $s_x$.

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 3

Identify the sample size.

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 4

Match the random variables $X$ and $\bar{X}$ to their definitions.

### Answer Section

## Part 5

Which of the following correctly identifies the distribution should you use for this problem, and correctly explains why?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part5.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part5.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part5.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part5.ans4.value }}

## Part 6

Calculate a {{ params.confidence_level }}% confidence interval.

### Answer Section

## Part 7

Calculate the margin of error for the confidence interval calculated in part 6.

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.
