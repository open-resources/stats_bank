# {{ params.vars.title }}
${{ params.description.num1 }}$ UCLA students were asked to fill out a survey where they were asked about their height, fastest speed they have ever driven, and gender. The first scatterplot displays the relationship between height and fastest speed, and the second scatterplot displays the breakdown by gender in this relationship.

<img src="speed_vs_height.png" alt="A scatterplot is shown. The horizontal axis represents 'Height (in inches)' with values ranging from about 50 to 80. The vertical axis represents 'Fastest Speed (in mph)' and has values ranging from 0 to 150. First, it is worth noting that there several points along the bottom of the plot with a fastest speed of 0 mph. The remainder of the description will concentrate on the other points. A small portion of the points are shown with heights below 60 inches, and these have fastest speeds mostly ranging from about 70 to 110 mph. For points shown with heights between 60 and 70, fastest speeds mostly ranged from about 30 to 120 mph. For points shown with heights of 70 or more, fastest speeds mostly ranged from about 50 to 140 mph. There were no points corresponding to heights greater than 75 that had fastest speeds slower than about 75 mph, which left a sort of gap in the lower right portion of the scatterplot." width=400>

<img src="gender_breakdown.png" alt="A scatterplot is shown, where points are colored to differentiate between males and females. The horizontal axis represents 'Height (in inches)' with values ranging from about 50 to 80. The vertical axis represents 'Fastest Speed (in mph)' and has values ranging from 0 to 150. Female heights are largely 70 inches or smaller, while Male heights are largely 65 inches and taller. When focusing exclusively on Females, no upward trend is evident, with about 95\% of observations having Fastest Speed between about 30 mph and 120 mph. When focusing exclusively on Males, no upward trend is evident there either, with about 95\% of observations having Fastest Speed between about 50 mph and 140 mph. In contrast, if we ignore the male/female differentiation, there is a slight upward trend in the points." width=400>
