      part1:
        option1:
          value: The number of adult Americans who were surveyed.
        option2:
          value: The proportion of all americans surveyed.
        statement1:
          value: $X$
          matches: The number of adult Americans who feel that crime is the main problem.
        statement2:
          value: $P^\prime$
          matches: The proportion of adult Americans who feel that crime is the main
            problem

          value: $\operatorname{N}\left(0.77, \frac{0.23}{\sqrt{522.50}}\right)$

        ans2:
          value: $\operatorname{N}\left(0.23, \sqrt{\frac{(0.23)(1 - 0.23)}{1045.00}}\right)$

          value: $\operatorname{N}\left(0,1\right)$ (Standard Normal)
          feedback: Try Again!
      part5:
        ans1:
          value: This represents the maximum error bound. This means that those doing
            the study are reporting a maximum error of 4%.
          feedback: You got it!
        ans2:
          value: This represents the minimum error bound. This means that those doing
            the study are reporting a minimum error of 4%.
          feedback: Try Again!
        ans3:
          value: They estimate the percentage of adult Americans who feel that crime
            is the main problem to be above 23%.
          feedback: Try Again!
        ans4:
          value: They estimate the percentage of adult Americans who feel that crime
            is the main problem to be between the upper and lower bound values calculated
            in part 3.

# {{ params.vars.title }}
A telephone poll of {{params.n}} adult Americans was reported in an issue of Time Magazine. One of the questions asked was "What is the main problem facing the country?" {{params.p_hat}} percent answered "crime." We are interested in the population proportion of adult Americans who feel that crime is the main problem.

## Part 1

Define the random variables $X$ and $P^\prime$ in words.

### Answer Section

## Part 2

Which distribution should be used for this problem?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part2.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans4.value }}

## Part 3

Construct a {{params.confidence_level}}% confidence interval for the population proportion of adult Americans who feel that crime is the main problem (as percentage values).

### Answer Section

## Part 4

Calculate the error bound.

### Answer Section

## Part 5

The sampling error given by Yankelovich Partners, Inc. (which conducted the poll) is $\pm{{params.error_percent}}$%. In one to three complete sentences, explain what the $\pm{{params.error_percent}}$% represents.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part5.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part5.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part5.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part5.ans4.value }}
