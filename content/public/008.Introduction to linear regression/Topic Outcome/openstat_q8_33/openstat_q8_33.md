          feedback: Try again please!
      part2:
        ans1:
          value: The data provide convincing evidence that wives' and husbands' heights
            are positively correlated. The p-value, as reported in the table, is smaller
            than 0.05, so we reject $H_0$.
        ans2:
          value: The data does not provide convincing evidence that wives' and husbands'
            heights are positively correlated. The p-value, as reported in the table,
            is significant, so we fail to reject $H_0$.
        ans3:
          value: There is no sufficient information to make a conclusion.
          feedback: Try again please!
      Part2:

        ans1:
          value: 'Slope: For each additional inch in husband''s height, the average
            wife''s height is expected to be an additional (slope value) inches on
            average.'
          feedback: Correct!
        ans2:
          value: 'Slope: For each additional inch in wife''s height, the average husbands''s
            height is expected to be an additional (slope value) inches on average.'
          feedback: Try again please!
        ans3:
          value: 'Intercept: Men who are 0 inches tall are expected to have wives
            who are on average, (intercept value) inches tall.'
          feedback: Correct!
        ans4:
          value: 'Intercept: Men who are (intercept value) inches tall are expected
            to have wives who are on average, 0 inches tall.'
          feedback: Try Again!
        ans5:
          value: The intercept here is meaningless, and it serves only to adjust the
            height of the line.
          feedback: Correct!
      part8:
        ans1:
          value: The prediction based on this regression model is very reliable from
            the given R value.
          feedback: Incorrect!
        ans2:
          value: Since $R^2$ is low, the prediction based on this regression model
            is not very reliable.
          feedback: Correct!
      part9:
        ans1:
          value: 'No'
          feedback: Incorrect! The husbands' height height within our data range.
        ans2:
          value: 'Yes'
          feedback: Correct! The husbands' height height within our data range.

# {{ params.vars.title }}
The scatter plot below summarizes husbands' and wives' heights in a random sample of ${{ params.sample}}$ married couples in Britain, where both partners' ages are below $65$ years. The summary output of the least squares fit for predicting a wife's height from the husband's height is also provided in the table.

## Part 6

Given that $R^2 = {{params.correlation}}$, what is the correlation of heights in this data set?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 7

You meet a married man from Britain who is ${{ params.husband_height1 }}$ inches. What would you predict his wife's height to be?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.
