# {{ params.vars.title }}
The Ice Chalet offers dozens of different beginning ice-skating classes. All of the class names are put into a bucket. The 5 P.M., Monday night, ages 8 to 12, beginning ice-skating class was picked. In that class were ${{params.num_girls}}$ girls and ${{params.num_boys}}$ boys. Suppose that we are interested in the true proportion of girls, ages 8 to 12, in all beginning ice-skating classes at the Ice Chalet. Assume that the children in the selected class are a random population sample.

## Part 1

{{params.selected_question}}

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans4.value }}

## Variables

Match the variables $x$, $n$, and $p^\prime$ with correct values.

### Answer Section

## Distribution

Define a new random variable $P^\prime$. Which of the following states the estimated distribution?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part3.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part3.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part3.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part3.ans4.value }}

### Answer Section

## Confidence Interval

Construct a ${{params.confidence_level}}$% Confidence Interval for the true proportion of girls in the ages 8 to 12 beginning ice-skating classes at the Ice Chalet.

### Answer Section

## Tail Area

How much area is in each tail?

## Part 6

Examine the ${{params.confidence_level}}$% confidence interval you got above. What does the interval mean?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part6.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part6.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part6.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part6.ans4.value }}

## Part 7

Using the same $p^\prime$ and n = ${{params.n}}$, how would the error bound change if the confidence level were increased to 98%, assuming all other variables are kept constant?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part7.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part7.ans2.value }}
