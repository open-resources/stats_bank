    params_vars_question: Cards dealt in a hand of poker.
    params_part1_ans1_value: 'True'
    params_part1_ans1_feedback: The cards are not independent. For example, if the
      first card is an ace of clubs, that implies the second card cannot be an ace
      of clubs. Additionally, there are many possible categories, which would need
      to be simplified.
    params_part1_ans2_value: 'False'
    params_part1_ans2_feedback: Great! You got it.
