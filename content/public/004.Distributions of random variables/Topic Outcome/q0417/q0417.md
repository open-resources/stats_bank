# {{ params_vars_title }}
Data collected by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) suggests that $ {{ params_percentage }} $% of 18-20 year olds consumed alcoholic beverages in any given year.

## Part 1

Suppose a random sample of ten 18-20 year olds is taken. Is the use of the binomial distribution
appropriate for calculating the probability that exactly six consumed alcoholic beverages?

### Answer Section

- {{ params_part1_ans1_value }}
- {{ params_part1_ans2_value }}

## Part 2

Calculate the probability that exactly ${{params_k2}}$ out of ${{params_n2}}$ randomly sampled 18-20 year olds consumed an
alcoholic drink.

## Part 3

What is the probability that exactly ${{params_k3}}$ out of ${{params_n3}}$ 18-20 year olds have NOT consumed an alcoholic beverage?

## Part 4

What is the probability that at most ${{params_k4}}$ out of ${{params_n4}}$ randomly sampled 18-20 year olds have consumed alcoholic beverages?

## Part 5

What is the probability that at least ${{params_k5}}$ out of ${{params_n5}}$ randomly sampled 18-20 year olds have consumed alcoholic beverages?
