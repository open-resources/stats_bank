# {{ params_vars_title }}
Suppose a newspaper article states that the distribution of auto insurance premiums for residents of California is approximately normal with a mean of ${{ params_description_num1 }}$ dollar. The article also states that ${{params.description.top_percent}}$% of California residents pay more than ${{ params_description_num3 }}$ dollar.

## Part 1

What is the Z-score that corresponds to the top ${{params.description.top_percent}}$% (or the ${{params_description_percentile}}^{th}$ percentile) of the standard normal distribution?

### pl-answer-panel

$Z=0.67$

## Part 2

What is the mean insurance cost?

### pl-answer-panel

$\mu=$1650$

## Part 3

What is the cutoff for the ${{params_description_percentile}}^{th}$ percentile?

### pl-answer-panel

$x=$1800$

## Part 4

Identify the standard deviation of insurance premiums in California.

### pl-answer-panel

$0.67 = \frac{1800-1650}{\sigma} \to \sigma=$223.88$
