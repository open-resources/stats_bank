# {{ params.vars.title }}
Suppose a newspaper article states that the distribution of auto insurance premiums for residents of California is approximately normal with a mean of ${{ params.description.num1 }}$ dollar. The article also states that ${{params.description.top_percent}}$% of California residents pay more than ${{ params.description.num3 }}$ dollar.

## Part 1

What is the Z-score that corresponds to the top ${{params.description.top_percent}}$% (or the ${{params.description.percentile}}^{th}$ percentile) of the standard normal distribution?

## Part 2

What is the mean insurance cost?

## Part 3

What is the cutoff for the ${{params.description.percentile}}^{th}$ percentile?

## Part 4

Identify the standard deviation of insurance premiums in California.
