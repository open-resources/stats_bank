# {{ params.vars.title }}
In a city with ${{ params.N }}$ restaurants, only ${{ params.K }}$ of them have kids menus. Suppose a family visiting this city eats dinner at one of these restaurants chosen at random for a ${{ params.n }}$ days. Answer the following questions assuming they sample restaurants without replacement, that is, they do not visit a restaurant more than once. Round all answers to three decimal places.

## Part 1

(1 point) Let X denote the number of restaurants that the family visits within the week that have kids menus. What distribution does X follow?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans4.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans5.value }}

## Part 2

(1 point) What is the support of this random variable?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part2.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans4.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans5.value }}

## Part 3

(1 point) What is the probability that less than half of the restaurants they visit have a kids menu?

## Part 4

(1 point) What is the expected number of restaurants with kidsâ€™ menus they visit during that week. Hint: you may use a result from the formula sheet.

## Part 5

(1 point) How would the probability in part 3 change if the family samples restaurants with replacement. That is, they permit themselves to revisit a restaurant.
