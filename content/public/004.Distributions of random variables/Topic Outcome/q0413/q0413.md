# {{ params_vars_title }}
A husband and wife both have brown eyes but carry genes that make it possible for their children to have brown eyes (probability ${{params_c1}}$), blue eyes (${{params_c2}}$), or green eyes (${{params_c3}}$).

## Part 1

What is the probability the first blue-eyed child they have is their third child? Assume that the eye colors of the children are independent of each other.

## Part 2

On average, how many children would such a pair of parents have before having a blue-eyed child?

## Part 3

For the previous part, what is the standard deviation of the number of children they would expect to have until the first blue-eyed child?
