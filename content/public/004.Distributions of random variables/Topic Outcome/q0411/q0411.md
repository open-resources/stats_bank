    params_part1_ans1_value: 'True'
    params_part1_ans1_feedback: Tossing a fair coin twice has four possible outcomes
      (HH, HT, TH, and TT). This does not fit the definition of a Bernoulli trial
      because it has more than two outcomes.
    params_part1_ans2_value: 'False'
    params_part1_ans2_feedback: Great! You got it.
