        question: Observing the weather over a week.
      part1:
        ans1:
          value: 'True'
          feedback: The outcomes are not independent of each other because the weather
            conditions on subsequent days can be influenced by previous days' conditions.
        ans2:
          value: 'False'
          feedback: Great! You got it.
