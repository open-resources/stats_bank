        title: Is it Bernoulli?
        question: Outcome of each roll of a die.
      part1:
        ans1:
          value: 'True'
          feedback: There are six events under consideration. The Bernoulli distribution
            allows for only two events or categories. Note that rolling a die could
            be a Bernoulli trial if we simplify to two events, e.g. rolling a 6 and
            not rolling a 6, though specifying such details would be necessary.
        ans2:
          value: 'False'
          feedback: Great! You got it.
