# {{ params.vars.title }}
The average daily high temperature in June in LA is  ${{ params.mu }} ^{\circ} F$ with a standard deviation of ${{params.sig}} ^{\circ} F$. Suppose that the temperatures in June closely follow a normal distribution.

## Part 1

What is the probability of observing an $${{params.temp}} ^{\circ} F$$ temperature or higher in LA during a randomly chosen day in June?

## Part 2

How cool are the coldest {{params.percent}}%  of the days (days with lowest high temperature) during June in LA? Round to 1 decimal place.
