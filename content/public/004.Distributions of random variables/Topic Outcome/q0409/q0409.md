# {{ params.vars.title }}
The average daily high temperature in June in LA is $${{params.mu}} ^{\circ} F$$ with a standard deviation of $${{params.sig}} ^{\circ} F$$, and it can be assumed that they do follow a normal distribution. We use the following equation to convert $$^{\circ} F$$ (Fahrenheit) to $$^{\circ} C$$ (Celsius):

$$C = (F-32)\cdot \frac{5}{9}$$

## Part 1

Write the mean of the probability model for the distribution of temperature in  $$^{\circ} C$$ in June in LA.

## Part 2

Write the standard deviation of the probability model for the distribution of temperature in  $$^{\circ} C$$ in June in LA.

## Part 3

What is the probability of observing a $${{params.temp_C}} ^{\circ} C$$ (which roughly corresponds to $${{params.temp}} ^{\circ} F$$) temperature or higher in June in LA? Calculate using the $$^{\circ} C$$ model from part 1 & 2.

## Part 4

The probability of observing $${{params.temp}} ^{\circ} F$$ temperature of higher in June in LA is {{params.prob}}.
Compare the answer with the one in part 3 of this question. Are you surprised? Explain.

### Answer Section

## Part 5

Estimate the IQR of the temperatures (in $$^{\circ} C$$) in June in LA.
