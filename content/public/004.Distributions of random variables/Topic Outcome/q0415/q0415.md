# {{ params.vars.title }}
Recall from Section 3.4, we calculate the expected value of a discrete random variable with the following formula:

$$ E(X) =  \sum\_{i=1}^k x_i P(X=x_i)$$

## Part 1

Use this probability rule to derive the mean of a Bernoulli random variable, i.e. a random variable $$X$$ that takes value $$1$$ with probability $$p$$ and value $$0$$ with probability $$1 - p$$. That is, compute the expected value of a generic Bernoulli random variable.
