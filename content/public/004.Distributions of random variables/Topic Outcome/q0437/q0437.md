# {{ params_vars_title }}
Suppose a university announced that it admitted ${{ params_description_num1 }}$ students for the following year's freshman class. However, the university has dorm room spots for only ${{ params_description_num2 }}$ freshman students.

If there is a ${{ params_description_num3 }}$% chance that an admitted student will decide to accept the offer and attend this university, what is the approximate probability that the university will not have enough dormitory room spots for the freshman class? .

## Part 1

Using the normal approximation

## Part 2

Using the normal approximation with the 0.5 cut-off correction

### pl-answer-panel

Want to find the probability that there will be 1,787 or more enrollees.
Using the normal approximation, with
$\mu = np = ${{ params_description_num1 }}$ \times 0.7 = 1750$ and
$\sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)} = \sqrt{2,500 \times 0.7 \times 0.3} \approx 23$,
$Z = 1.61$, and $P(Z > 1.61) = 0.0537$. With a 0.5 correction: 0.0559
