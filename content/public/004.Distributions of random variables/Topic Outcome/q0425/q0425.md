The formula for the number of ways to arrange $n$ objects is $n! = n\times(n-1)\times \cdots \times 2 \times 1$. This exercise walks you through the derivation of this formula for a couple of special cases.

A small company has ${{params_part0_list_length}}$ employees: ${{params_part0_list}}$. There are ${{params_part0_list_length}}$ parking spots in a row at the company, none of which are assigned, and each day the employees pull into a random parking spot. That is, all possible orderings of the cars in the row of spots are equally likely.

## Part 1

On a given day, what is the probability that the employees park in alphabetical order? (Answer in fraction.)

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

### pl-answer-panel

${1/ {{params_part0_list_length}} }\times .. \times{1/1} = 1/5!=1/{{correct_answers.part2_ans}}$

## Part 2

If the alphabetical order has an equal chance of occurring relative to all other possible orderings, how many ways must there be to arrange the five cars?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value.

### pl-answer-panel

Since the probabilities must add to 1, there must be ${{params_part0_list_length}}!={{correct_answers.part2_ans}}$ possible orderings

## Part 3

Now consider a sample of ${{ params_part3_num1 }}$ employees instead. How many possible ways are there to order these ${{ params_part3_num2 }}$ employees' cars?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value.

### pl-answer-panel

${{params_part3_num1}}!={{correct_answers.part3_ans}}$
