# {{ params_vars_title }}
A husband and wife with brown eyes who have ${{ params_description_num1 }}$ probability of having children with brown eyes, ${{ params_description_num2 }}$ probability of having children with blue eyes, and ${{ params_description_num3 }}$ probability of having children with green eyes.

## Part 1

What is the probability that their first child will have green eyes and the second will not?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value.

### pl-answer-panel

Geometric distribution: {{ correct_answers.part1_ans }}

## Part 2

What is the probability that exactly one of their two children will have green eyes?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value.

### pl-answer-panel

Binomial: {{ correct_answers.part2_ans }}

## Part 3

If they have six children, what is the probability that exactly two will have green eyes?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value.

### pl-answer-panel

Binomial: {{ correct_answers.part3_ans }}

## Part 4

If they have six children, what is the probability that at least one will have green eyes?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

### pl-answer-panel

$1-(1-{{ params_description_num3 }})^6={{ correct_answers.part4_ans }}$

## Part 5

What is the probability that the first green eyed child will be the $4^{th}$ child?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value.

### pl-answer-panel

Geometric: {{ correct_answers.part5_ans }}

## Part 6

Would it be considered unusual if only ${{ params_part6_num1 }}$ out of their ${{ params_part6_num2 }}$ children had brown eyes?

### Answer Section

- {{ params_part6_ans1_value }}
- {{ params_part6_ans2_value }}

### pl-answer-panel

Using a binomial distribution, $Z = {{params_part6_z}}$ Compare it with 2.
