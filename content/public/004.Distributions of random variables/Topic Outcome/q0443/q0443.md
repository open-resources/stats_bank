# {{ params_vars_title }}
Suppose weights of the checked baggage of airline passengers follow a nearly normal distribution with mean ${{ params_description_num1 }}$ pounds and standard deviation ${{ params_description_num2 }}$ pounds. Most airlines charge a fee for baggage that weigh in excess of ${{ params_description_num3 }}$ pounds.

## Part 1

Determine what percent of airline passengers incur this fee.
