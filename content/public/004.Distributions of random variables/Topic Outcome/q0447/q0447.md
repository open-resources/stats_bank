# {{ params.vars.title }}
Heights of ${{ params.age }}$ year olds, regardless of gender, closely follow a normal distribution with mean ${{ params.mean }}$ inches and standard deviation ${{ params.std }}$ inches.

## Part 1

What fraction of ${{ params.age }}$ year olds are taller than ${{ params.height }}$ inches?

## Part 2

If there are ${{ params.size }}$ ${{ params.age }}$ year olds entering Six Flags Magic Mountain in a single day, then compute the expected number of ${{ params.age }}$ year olds who are at least ${{ params.height }}$ inches tall. (You may assume the heights of the {{ params.age }}-year olds are independent.)

## Part 3

Using the binomial distribution, compute the probability that ${{ params.number }}$ of the ${{ params.size }}$ ${{ params.age }}$ year olds will be at least ${{ params.height }}$ inches tall.

## Part 4

The number of ${{ params.age }}$ year olds who enter Six Flags Magic Mountain and are at least ${{ params.height}}$ inches tall in a given day follows a Poisson distribution with mean equal to the value found in part (2). Use the Poisson distribution to identify the probability no ${{ params.age }}$ year old will enter the park who is ${{ params.height }}$ inches or taller.
