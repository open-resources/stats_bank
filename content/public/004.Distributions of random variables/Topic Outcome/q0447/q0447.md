# {{ params_vars_title }}
Heights of ${{ params_age }}$ year olds, regardless of gender, closely follow a normal distribution with mean ${{ params_mean }}$ inches and standard deviation ${{ params_std }}$ inches.

## Part 1

What fraction of ${{ params_age }}$ year olds are taller than ${{ params_height }}$ inches?

## Part 2

If there are ${{ params_size }}$ ${{ params_age }}$ year olds entering Six Flags Magic Mountain in a single day, then compute the expected number of ${{ params_age }}$ year olds who are at least ${{ params_height }}$ inches tall. (You may assume the heights of the {{ params_age }}-year olds are independent.)

## Part 3

Using the binomial distribution, compute the probability that ${{ params_number }}$ of the ${{ params_size }}$ ${{ params_age }}$ year olds will be at least ${{ params_height }}$ inches tall.

## Part 4

The number of ${{ params_age }}$ year olds who enter Six Flags Magic Mountain and are at least ${{ params_height}}$ inches tall in a given day follows a Poisson distribution with mean equal to the value found in part (2). Use the Poisson distribution to identify the probability no ${{ params_age }}$ year old will enter the park who is ${{ params_height }}$ inches or taller.
