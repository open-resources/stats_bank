        ans2:
          value: Normal
          feedback: You got it! We know the standard deviation for the population,
            and the sample size is greater than 30.

      part5:
        ans1:
          value: The confidence interval will decrease in size, because the sample
            size increased.
          feedback: You got it!
        ans2:
          value: The confidence interval will increase in size, because the sample
            size decreased.
          feedback: Try Again!
        ans3:
          value: The increase in sample size decreases variability. Thus, we do not
            need as large an interval to capture the true population mean.
          feedback: You got it!
        ans4:
          value: The confidence interval will be the same regardless of the sample
            size changes.

# {{ params.vars.title }}
Among various ethnic groups, the standard deviation of heights is known to be approximately three inches. We wish to construct a ${{params.confidence_level}}$% confidence interval for the mean height of male Swedes. ${{params.n}}$ male Swedes are surveyed. The sample mean is ${{params.sample_mean}}$ inches. The sample standard deviation is ${{params.population_std_dev}}$ inches.

## Part 1

Match the parameters $\bar{x}$, $\sigma$, $n$ with their correct values, and define the random variables $X$ and $\bar{X}$.

### Answer Section

## Distribution

Which distribution should you use for this problem?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part2.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans4.value }}

## Confidence Interval

Construct a ${{params.confidence_level}}$% confidence interval for the population mean height of male Swedes.

State the confidence interval.

### Answer Section

## Margin of Error

Calculate the margin of error.

### Answer Section

## Part 5

What will happen to the level of confidence obtained if ${{params.n2}}$ male Swedes are surveyed instead of ${{params.n}}$?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part5.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part5.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part5.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part5.ans4.value }}
