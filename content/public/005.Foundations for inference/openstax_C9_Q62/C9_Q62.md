        ans1:
          value: '$H_0: μ \geq 6; H_a: μ < 6$'

        statement1:
          value: Type I Error
          matches: We conclude that the mean μ is less than 6, when it really is 6
            or more.
        statement2:
          value: Type II Error
          matches: We conclude that the mean μ is 6 or more, when in fact it is less
            than 6.
      question_text: The mean number of weeks of paid vacation time for Europeans
        each year is less than 6
