          value: Type I Error
          matches: We conclude that the mean p is less than 11%, when it really is
            11% or more.
        statement2:
          value: Type II Error
          matches: We conclude that the mean p is 11% or more, when in fact it is
            less than 11%.
      question_text: The chance of developing breast cancer for females is less than
        11%
