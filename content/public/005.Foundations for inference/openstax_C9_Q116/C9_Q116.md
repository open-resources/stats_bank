# {{ params.vars.title }}
The student academic group on a college campus claims that first-year students study {{params.question}} {{params.mu_0}} minutes per day, on average. One Introduction to Statistics class was skeptical. The class took a random sample of {{params.n}} first-year students and found a mean study time of {{params.sample_mean}} minutes with a standard deviation of {{params.std_dev}} minutes. At α = {{params.alpha}} level:

## Part 1

Select the appropriate hypothesis.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans4.value }}

## Part 2

Calculate the p-value.

## Part 3

Which statement about the academic group's claim is correct?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part3.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part3.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part3.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part3.ans4.value }}
