# {{ params.vars.title }}
The mean age for all Foothill College students for a recent Fall term was 33.2. The population standard deviation has been pretty consistent at {{ params.sigma }}. Suppose that {{ params.sample_size }} Winter students were randomly selected. The mean age for the sample was {{ params.x_bar }}. We are interested in the true mean age for Winter Foothill College students. Let $X$ = the age of a Winter Foothill College student.

*For parts 8 through 15, you'll be asked to construct a {{ params.confidence }}% Confidence Interval for the true mean age of Winter Foothill College students by working out then answering the next seven exercises.*

## Part 1

Identify the sample mean

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 2

Identify the sample size.

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 3

What measure is this?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 4

Identify the correct definition of the random variable $\bar{X}$.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part4.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans4.value }}

## Part 5

What is $\bar{x}$ estimating?

### Answer Section

## Part 6

Is $\sigma_x$ known?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part6.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part6.ans2.value }}

## Part 7

Based on your answer to part 4, state the exact distribution to use when calculating the confidence interval. (e.g. $N(0,1)$)

### Answer Section

## Part 8

How much area is in both tails (combined)?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 9

How much area is in each tail?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 10

Identify the error bound of the confidence interval.

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 11

Identify the confidence interval.

### Answer Section

## Part 12

Please match each of the following blanks on the graph with their values.

### Answer Section

## Part 13

Which of the following correctly explains what the interval means?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part13.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part13.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part13.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part13.ans4.value }}
- {{ params.part13.ans5.value }}
- {{ params.part13.ans6.value }}
- {{ params.part13.ans7.value }}

## Part 14

Using the same mean, standard deviation, and level of confidence, how would the error bound change if $n$ were {{ params.fake_sample_size }} instead of 25? Why?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part14.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part14.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part14.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part14.ans4.value }}

## Part 15

Using the same mean, standard deviation, and sample size, how would the error bound change if the confidence level were {{ params.fake_confidence }}% instead of {{ params.confidence }}%? Why?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part15.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part15.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part15.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part15.ans4.value }}
