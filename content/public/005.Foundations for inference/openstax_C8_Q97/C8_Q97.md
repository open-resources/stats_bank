        ans2:
          value: $\operatorname{N}(28.4, \frac{6.9}{\sqrt{195}})$
          feedback: You got it! We know the standard deviation for the population,
            and the sample size is greater than 30.
        ans3:
          value: $\operatorname{B}(39.4, \frac{39.4}{\sqrt{195}})$
          feedback: Try Again!

      part5:
        ans1:
          value: It will need to change the sample size.
          feedback: You got it!
        ans2:
          value: The firm needs to determine what the confidence level should be,
            then apply the margin of error formula to determine the necessary sample
            size.
          feedback: You got it!
        ans3:
          value: The firm needs to maintain its sample size in order to maintain the
            same margin of error.
          feedback: Try Again!
        ans4:
          value: It is impossible to maintain an margin of error while changing confidence
            level and size. The firm needs to determine what the confidence level
            should be, and find a new margin of error.
          feedback: Try again please!
      part6:
        ans1:
          value: The confidence interval will decrease in size, as a result of a narrower
            interval.
          feedback: Try Again!
        ans2:
          value: The confidence interval will increase in size, as a result of a larger
            interval.
          feedback: You got it!
        ans3:
          value: Smaller sample sizes result in more variability. To capture the true
            population mean, we need to have a larger interval.
          feedback: You got it!
        ans4:
          value: The confidence interval will be the same regardless of the sample
            size changes.

# {{ params.vars.title }}
Suppose that an accounting firm does a study to determine the time needed to complete one person’s tax forms. It randomly surveys ${{params.n}}$ people. The sample mean is ${{params.sample_mean}}$ hours. There is a known standard deviation of ${{params.population_std_dev}}$ hours. The population distribution is assumed to be normal.

## Part 1

Match the parameters $\bar{x}$, $\sigma$, $n$ with their correct values, and define the random variables $X$ and $\bar{X}$.

### Answer Section

## Part 2

Which distribution should you use for this problem?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part2.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans4.value }}

## Part 3

Construct a ${{params.confidence_level}}$% confidence interval for the population mean time to complete the tax forms.

State the confidence interval.

### Answer Section

## Margin of Error

Calculate the margin of error.

### Answer Section

## Part 5

If the firm wished to increase its level of confidence and keep the margin of error the same by taking another survey, what changes should it make?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part5.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part5.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part5.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part5.ans4.value }}

## Part 6

If the firm did another survey, kept the margin of error the same, and surveyed ${{params.n2}}$ people, what would happen to the level of confidence?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part6.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part6.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part6.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part6.ans4.value }}

## Part 7

Suppose that the firm decided that it needed to be ${{params.confidence_level2}}$% confident of the population mean length of time to within ${{params.desired_error_bound}}$ hour(s). What would be the number of people the survey needs to achieve this?
