# {{ params.vars.title }}
The Weather Underground reported that the mean amount of summer rainfall for the northeastern US is at least {{params.mu}} inches. {{params.n}} cities in the northeast are randomly selected and the mean rainfall amount is calculated to be {{params.sample_mean}} inches with a standard deviation of {{params.std_dev}} inches.

Assume the amount of summer rainfall follows a normal distribution.

## Part 1

Set up the hypotheses to use in the test.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans4.value }}

## Part 2

Calculate the p-value using $\alpha = 0.05$.

## Part 3

What is your conclusion using $\alpha = 0.05$?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part3.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part3.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part3.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part3.ans4.value }}

## Part 4

What if $\alpha = 0.01$?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part4.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans4.value }}
