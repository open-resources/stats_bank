# {{ params.vars.title }}
Toastmasters International cites a report by Gallup Poll that {{ params.p0 }}% of Americans fear public speaking. A student believes that less than {{ params.p0 }}% of students at their school fear public speaking. The student randomly surveys {{ params.n }} schoolmates and finds that {{ params.x }} report they fear public speaking. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the percent at their school is less than {{ params.p0 }}%.

Let $P^\prime$ be the proportion of schoolmates who fear public speaking.

## Part 1

Set up the hypotheses.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans4.value }}

## Part 2

Identify the test type to use in this case.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part2.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans4.value }}

## Part 3

Using a significant level of {{ params.alpha }}, calculate the p-value.

## Part 4

What is your conclusion?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part4.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans4.value }}

## Part 5

Using a {{params.confidence_level}}% confidence level, calculate the confidence interval.

## Part 6

What are the "plus-4" confidence interval values?
