# {{ params.vars.title }}
The U.S. Census Bureau conducts a study to determine the time needed to complete the short form. The Bureau surveys {{ params.sample_size }} people. The sample mean is {{ params.x_bar }} minutes. There is a known standard deviation of {{ params.sigma }} minutes. The population distribution is assumed to be normal.

## Part 1

Identify the sample mean

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 2

Identify the standard deviation

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 3

Identify the sample size

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 4

Please define the distribution that should be used. (Ex. $exp(1)$, $N(0,1)$, $B(5, 0.5)$)

### Answer Section

## Part 5

Is the following graph a proper representation of the {{ params.confidence }}% confidence interval?

<pl-figure file-name="figure 1.png" type="dynamic" width="500px"></pl-figure>

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part5.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part5.ans2.value }}

## Part 6

What should the error bound be for the confidence interval with {{ params.confidence }}% confidence level?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 7

If the Census did another survey, kept the error bound the same, and surveyed {{ params.other_sample_size }} people instead of 200, what would happen to the level of confidence? Why?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part7.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part7.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part7.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part7.ans4.value }}

## Part 8

Suppose the Census needed to be {{ params.higher_confidence }}% confident of the population mean length of time. Without changing the error bound from part 6, how many people would need to be surveyed?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.
