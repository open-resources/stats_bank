      part2:
        ans1:
          value: The sample size needed would increase as the confidence level increases.
            As the confidence level increases α decreases, and the critical value
            increases. To maintain the same margin of error, the sample size needs
            to increase accordingly.
          feedback: You got it!
        ans2:
          value: Minimum sample size for 99.0% confidence and 0.05 margin of error

        ans4:
          value: The sample size needed would decrease as the confidence level increases.
            As the confidence level, the critical value decreases.

# {{ params.vars.title }}
Marketing companies are interested in knowing the population percent of women who make the majority of household purchasing decisions.

## Sample Size

When designing a study to determine this population proportion, what is the minimum number you would need to survey to be ${{params.confidence1}}$% confident that the population proportion is estimated to be within 0.05?

### Answer Section

## Confidence Level

If it were later determined that it was important to be ${{params.confidence2}}$% confident and a new survey were commissioned, how would it affect the minimum number you need to survey?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part2.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans4.value }}

## Definitions

Suppose the marketing company did do a survey. They randomly surveyed ${{params.n}}$ households and found that in ${{params.x}}$ of them, the woman made the majority of the purchasing decisions. We are interested in the population proportion of households where women make the majority of the purchasing decisions.

Given that $P^\prime = {{params.p_hat}}$, define the random variables X and $P^\prime$ in words.

### Answer Section

## Confidence Interval

Construct a ${{params.Confidence_percent}}$% confidence interval for the population proportion of households where the women make the majority of the purchasing decisions.

State the confidence interval.

### Answer Section

## Margin of Error

Calculate the margin of error.
