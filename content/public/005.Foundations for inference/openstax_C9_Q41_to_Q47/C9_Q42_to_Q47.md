# {{ params.vars.title }}
Suppose that a recent article stated that the mean time spent in jail by a first-time convicted burglar is {{params.mean}} years. A study was then done to see if the mean time has increased in the new century. A random sample of {{params.n}} first-time convicted burglars in a recent year was picked. The mean length of time in jail from the survey was three years with a standard deviation of {{params.sd}} years. Suppose that it is somehow known that the population standard deviation is {{params.pop_sd}}, conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the mean length of jail time has increased.

Assume the distribution of the jail times is approximately normal.

## Part 1

The above test is of:

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans4.value }}

## Part 2

Define the random variable for this test.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part2.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans4.value }}

## Part 3
