# {{ params.vars.title }}
Over the past few decades, public health officials have examined the link between weight concerns and teen girls' smoking. Researchers surveyed a group of {{ params.total_girls }} randomly selected teen girls living in Massachusetts (between 12 and 15 years old). After four years the girls were surveyed again. {{ params.smokers }} said they smoked to stay thin. Is there good evidence that more than {{ params.p0 }}% of the teen girls smoke to stay thin?
