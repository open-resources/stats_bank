        option1:
          value: The mean successes where an manual laborers prefers a truck.

          value: All sampled manual laborers individuals who prefer trucks.
        statement1:

          matches: The percentage of manual laborers sampled who prefer a truck.
      part4:
        ans1:
          value: The sampling error means that the population can be 2% above or below
            the sample mean.

          value: The sampling error means that the true mean can be 2% above or below

        ans3:
          value: The sampling error means that the true mean can be 4% above or below

# {{ params.vars.title }}
Of ${{params.total_population}}$ randomly selected adults, ${{params.manual_laborers_population}}$ identified themselves as manual laborers, ${{params.non_manual_population}}$ identified themselves as non-manual wage earners, ${{params.mid_level_managers_population}}$ identified themselves as mid-level managers, and ${{params.executives_population}}$ identified themselves as executives. In the survey, ${{params.manual_laborers_preference}}$% of manual laborers preferred trucks, ${{params.non_manual_preference}}$% of non-manual wage earners preferred trucks, ${{params.mid_level_managers_preference}}$% of mid-level managers preferred trucks, and ${{params.executives_preference}}$% of executives preferred trucks.

## Definitions

We are interested in finding the ${{params.confidence_level}}$% confidence interval for the percent of {{params.random_group}} who prefer trucks. In words, define random variables X and $P^{'}$.

### Answer Section

## Confidence Interval

Construct a ${{params.confidence_level}}$% confidence interval.

### Answer Section

## Margin of Error

Calculate the margin of error.

### Answer Section

## Sampling Error

The sampling error given in the survey is $\pm{{params.sampling_error}}$%. Explain what the $\pm{{params.sampling_error}}$% means.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part4.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans4.value }}
