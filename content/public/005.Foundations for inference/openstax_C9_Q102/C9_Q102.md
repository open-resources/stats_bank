# {{ params.vars.title }}
<div class="mathjax_ignore">
Registered nurses earned an average annual salary of ${{ params.mu }}.
For that same year, a survey was conducted of {{ params.n }} California registered nurses to determine if the annual salary is higher for California nurses.
The sample average was ${{ params.sample_mean }} with a sample standard deviation of ${{ params.sample_std }}.
</div>

All amounts are in USD.
