        ans1:
          value: There is enough evidence to conclude that the mean number of hours
            is more than 4.34.
          feedback: Try Again!
        ans2:
          value: There is not enough evidence to conclude that the mean number of
            hours is more than 4.34.
          feedback: You got it!
        ans3:
          value: There is not enough evidence to conclude that the mean number of

# {{ params.vars.title }}
Previously, an organization reported that teenagers spent {{ params.population_mean }} hours per week, on average, on the phone. The organization thinks that, currently, the mean is higher. {{ params.sample_size }} randomly chosen teenagers were asked how many hours per week they spend on the phone. The sample mean was {{ params.sample_mean }} hours with a sample standard deviation of {{ params.sample_std }}. Conduct a hypothesis test.

At a significance level of $\alpha = {{ params.alpha }}$, what is the correct conclusion?
