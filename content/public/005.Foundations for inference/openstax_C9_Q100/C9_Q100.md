# {{ params.vars.title }}
According to New York City's Community Health Survey, the most recent adult smoking rate is {{ params.p0 }}%. A survey is conducted to determine this year's rate and {{ params.x }} out of {{ params.n }} randomly chosen N.Y. City residents reply that they smoke. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the rate is still {{ params.p0 }}% or if it has decreased.

Let $P^\prime$ be the proportion of NYC residents that smoke.

## Part 1

Set up the hypotheses.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans4.value }}

## Part 2

What is the appropriate test type to use?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part2.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans4.value }}

## Part 3

Using a significant level of {{ params.alpha }}, calculate the p-value.

## Part 4

What is your conclusion of this survey?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part4.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans4.value }}

## Part 5

Using a {{params.confidence_level}}% confidence level, calculate the confidence interval.

## Part 6

Using the same confidence level, what are the "plus-4" confidence interval values?
