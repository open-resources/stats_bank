# {{ params.vars.title }}
Suppose the total sleep time per night among new parents is approximately Normally distributed with mean $\mu = {{ params.mu}}$ hours and standard deviation $\sigma = {{ params.sigma}}$.

## Part 1

How large a sample would we need to take to ensure that ${{ params.percent}}$% of the averages fall within ${{ params.time}}$ minutes of the true mean?
