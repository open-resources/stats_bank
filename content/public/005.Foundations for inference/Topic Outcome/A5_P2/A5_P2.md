# {{ params_vars_title }}
Suppose the total sleep time per night among new parents is approximately Normally distributed with mean $\mu = {{ params_mu}}$ hours and standard deviation $\sigma = {{ params_sigma}}$.

## Part 1

How large a sample would we need to take to ensure that ${{ params_percent}}$% of the averages fall within ${{ params_time}}$ minutes of the true mean?
