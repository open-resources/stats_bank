# {{ params_vars_title }}
A survey of UBCO students was conducted to examine stress levels returning back to in-person classes. A total of ${{ params_size}}$ students were asked to indicate their average stress levels since returning to campus on a scale of $1$ to $10$. Assuming the population standard deviation is $\sigma = {{ params_sigma}}$ and the mean score was $\mu = {{ params_mu}}$, answer the following questions.

## Part 1

Give the margin of error for the ${{ params_percent}}$%  confidence interval for this sample.

## Part 2

All else being equal, would the margin of error for a ${{ params_percent2}}$% confidence interval be bigger or smaller? (You should be able to answer this without actually doing the calculation)

### Answer Section

- {{ params_part2_ans1_value }}
- {{ params_part2_ans2_value }}
