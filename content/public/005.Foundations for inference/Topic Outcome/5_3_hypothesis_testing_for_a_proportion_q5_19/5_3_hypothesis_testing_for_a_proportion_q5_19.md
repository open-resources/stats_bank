        title: Cyberbullying rates
      part2:
        num1: 77
        ans1:
          value: Yes, the claim is supported since 77% is greater than the lower limit
            of the confidence interval.
          feedback: Try again please!
        ans2:
          value: Yes, the claim is supported because the upper limit of the confidence
            interval is 65%, which is close to 77%.
          feedback: Try again please!
        ans3:
          value: No, the claim is not supported since 77% falls outside the confidence
            interval.
          feedback: Correct! The value of 77% lies outside of the interval, so we
            have convincing evidence that the researcher's conjecture is wrong.
        ans4:
          value: No, the claim is not supported because the confidence interval is
            too narrow.
          feedback: Try again please!
      part3:
        num1: 90
        ans1:
          value: Yes, the claim would be supported, as a 90% confidence interval would
            be wider than a 95% confidence interval.
          feedback: Try again please!
        ans2:
          value: Yes, the claim would be supported, as a 90% confidence interval is
            less strict than a 95% confidence interval.
          feedback: Try again please!
        ans3:
          value: No, the claim would not be supported, as a 90% confidence interval
            would be narrower than a 95% confidence interval.
          feedback: Correct! A 90% confidence interval will be narrower than a 95%
            confidence interval. Even without calculating the interval, we can tell
            that 77% would not fall in the interval, and we would reject the researcher's
            conjecture based on a 90% confidence level as well.
        ans4:
          value: It cannot be determined without calculating the 90% confidence interval.
          feedback: Try again please!

        num1: 56
        num2: 65
        num3: 95
      part1:
        ans1:
          value: No, the claim is not supported because the upper limit of the interval
            is above 60%, which is not a majority.
          feedback: Try again please!
        ans2:
          value: Yes, the claim is supported, but only because the interval is above
            56%, not necessarily indicating a majority.
          feedback: Try again please!
        ans3:
          value: Yes, the claim is supported since the entire interval lies above
            50%, indicating a majority.
          feedback: Correct! This claim is reasonable since the entire interval lies
            above 50%.
        ans4:
          value: No, the claim is not supported because the interval is wide, implying
            a high level of uncertainty.
          feedback: Try again please!

# {{ params.vars.title }}
Teens were surveyed about cyberbullying, and ${{ params.description.num1 }}$% to ${{ params.description.num2 }}$% reported experiencing cyberbullying (${{ params.description.num3 }}$% confidence interval).

Answer the following questions based on this interval.

## Part 1

A newspaper claims that a majority of teens have experienced cyberbullying.

Is this claim supported by the confidence interval? Choose an appropriate reason.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans4.value }}

## Part 2

A researcher conjectured that ${{ params.part2.num1 }}$% of teens have experienced cyberbullying.

Is this claim supported by the confidence interval? Choose an appropriate reason.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part2.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans4.value }}

## Part 3

Without actually calculating the interval, determine if the claim of the researcher from part 2 would be supported based on a ${{ params.part3.num1 }}$% confidence interval?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part3.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part3.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part3.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part3.ans4.value }}
