# {{ params.vars.title }}
As part of a quality control process for computer chips, an engineer at a factory randomly samples ${{ params.description.num1 }}$ chips during a week of production to test the current rate of chips with severe defects.

She finds that ${{ params.description.num2 }}$ of the chips are defective.

## Part 1

What population is under consideration in the data set?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans4.value }}

## Part 2

What parameter is being estimated?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part2.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans4.value }}

## Part 3

What is the point estimate for the parameter? Please provide your answer to three decimal places.

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 4

What is the name of the statistic we use to measure the uncertainty of the point estimate?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part4.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans4.value }}

## Part 5

Compute the value from part 4 for this context. Please provide your answer to three decimal places.

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 6

The historical rate of defects is 10%.

Should the engineer be surprised by the observed rate of defects during the current week?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part6.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part6.ans2.value }}

## Part 7

Suppose the true population value was found to be 10%.

If we use this proportion to recompute the value in part 5 using $p = 0.1$ instead of $\hat{p}$, does the resulting value change much?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part7.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part7.ans2.value }}
