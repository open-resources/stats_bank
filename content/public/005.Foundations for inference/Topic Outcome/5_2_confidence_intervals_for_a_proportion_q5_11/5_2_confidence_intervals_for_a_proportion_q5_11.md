# {{ params.vars.title }}
A hospital administrator hoping to improve wait times decides to estimate the average emergency room waiting time at her hospital. She collects a simple random sample of ${{ params.description.num1 }}$ patients and determines the time (in minutes) between when they checked in to the ER until they were first seen by a doctor. A ${{ params.description.num2 }}$% confidence interval based on this sample is (${{ params.ci_lower }}$ minutes, ${{ params.ci_higher }}$ minutes), which is based on the normal model for the mean. Determine whether the following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning.

## Part 1

We are ${{ params.part1.num1 }}$% confident that the average waiting time of these ${{ params.part1.num2 }}$ emergency room patients is between ${{ params.ci_lower }}$ and ${{ params.ci_higher }}$ minutes.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans2.value }}

## Part 2

We are ${{ params.part2.num1 }}$% confident that the average waiting time of all patients at this hospital's emergency room is between ${{ params.ci_lower }}$ and ${{ params.ci_higher }}$ minutes.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part2.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans2.value }}

## Part 3

${{ params.part3.num1 }}$% of random samples have a sample mean between ${{ params.ci_lower }}$ and ${{ params.ci_higher }}$ minutes.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part3.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part3.ans2.value }}

## Part 4

A ${{ params.part4.num1 }}$% confidence interval would be narrower than the ${{ params.part4.num2 }}$% confidence interval since we need to be more sure of our estimate.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part4.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans2.value }}

## Part 5

The margin of error is ${{ params.part5.num1 }}$ and the sample mean is ${{ params.part5.num2 }}$.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part5.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part5.ans2.value }}

## Part 6

In order to decrease the margin of error of a ${{ params.part6.num1 }}$% confidence interval to half of what it is now, we would need to double the sample size. (Hint: the margin of error for a mean scales in the same way with sample size as the margin of error for a proportion.)

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part6.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part6.ans2.value }}
