# {{ params.vars.title }}
You are given the following hypotheses:

$H_0$: p = ${{ params.description.num1 }}$

$H_A$: p $\neq {{ params.description.num2 }}$

We know the sample size is ${{ params.description.num3 }}$. For what sample proportion would the p-value be equal to ${{ params.description.num4 }}$? Assume that all conditions  necessary for inference are satisfied.

## Part 1

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 2

Use negative test statistic. Please provide your answer to three decimal places.

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.
