# {{ params.vars.title }}
Suppose that $X$, the time between sent text messages for Canadian teenagers, follows an exponential distribution with rate $\lambda = \frac{1}{ {{params.mu}} }$. Suppose we ask Stacy (a Canadian teenager) to record the next ${{params.size}}$ times between sent text messages and take the average.

## Part 1

What distribution does $\overline{X}$, the sample mean time in minutes between text messages, follow? Please note that we are parameterizing the Normal distribution using the standard deviation, i.e. of the form $N(\mu, \sigma)$

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans4.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans5.value }}

## Part 2

What is the probability that the average sample mean time exceeds ${{params.exceed}}$ minutes?

## Part 3

What is probability that the total time between the $1^{st}$ and $ {{ params.endsize }} ^{st}$ text message exceeds ${{ params.totaltime }}$ minutes?
