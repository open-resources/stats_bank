            condition.
          feedback: Correct!
        ans2:

# {{ params.vars.title }}
A nonprofit wants to understand the fraction of households that have elevated levels of lead in their drinking water.

They expect at least ${{ params.description.num1 }}$% of homes will have elevated levels of lead, but not more than about ${{ params.description.num2 }}$%.

They randomly sample ${{ params.description.num3 }}$ homes and work with the owners to retrieve water samples, and they compute the fraction of these homes with elevated lead levels.

They repeat this ${{ params.description.num4}}$ times and build a distribution of sample proportions.

## Part 1

What is this distribution called?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans4.value }}

## Part 2

Would you expect the shape of this distribution to be symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed? Choose appropriate reasoning.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part2.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans4.value }}

## Part 3

If the proportions are distributed around ${{ params.part3.num1 }}$%, what is the variability of the distribution? Please provide your answer to four decimal places.

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 4

What is the formal name of the value you computed in part 3?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part4.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans4.value }}

## Part 5

Suppose the researchers' budget is {{ params.text_part5.budget }}, and they are {{ params.text_part5.only }}able to collect ${{ params.part5.num1 }}$ observations per sample, but they {{ params.text_part5.can }}still collect ${{ params.part5.num2 }}$ samples.

They build a new distribution of sample proportions.

How will the variability of this new distribution compare to the variability of the distribution when each sample contained ${{ params.part5.num3 }}$ observations?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part5.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part5.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part5.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part5.ans4.value }}
