        ans1:
          value: Independence
          feedback: Correct!

          feedback: Correct!
      part3:
        ans1:
          value: The 90% confidence interval is approximately (0.0721, 0.1022). We
            are 90% confident that the true proportion of all first-time visitors
            who would register under the new design is between 7.21% and 10.22%.
          feedback: Try again please!
        ans2:
          value: The 90% confidence interval is approximately (0.0681, 0.1072). We
            are 90% confident that the true proportion of all first-time visitors
            who would register under the new design is between 6.81% and 10.72%.
          feedback: Try again please!
        ans3:
          value: The 90% confidence interval is approximately (0.0681, 0.1022). We
            are 90% confident that the true proportion of all first-time visitors
            who would register under the new design is between 6.81% and 10.22%.

        ans4:
          value: The 90% confidence interval is approximately (0.0721, 0.1072). We
            are 90% confident that the true proportion of all first-time visitors
            who would register under the new design is between 7.21% and 10.72%.
          feedback: Correct!

# {{ params.vars.title }}
A website is trying to increase registration for first-time visitors, exposing 1% of these visitors to a new site design.

Of ${{ params.description.num1 }}$ randomly sampled visitors over a month who saw the new design, ${{ params.description.num2 }}$ registered.

## Part 1

Check any conditions required for constructing a confidence interval.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value}}
- {{ params.part1.ans2.value}}

## Part 2

Compute the standard error. Please provide your answer to three decimal places.

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 3

Which of the following best describes this confidence interval for the fraction of first-time visitors of the site who would register under the new design (assuming stable behaviors by new visitors over time)?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part3.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part3.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part3.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part3.ans4.value }}
