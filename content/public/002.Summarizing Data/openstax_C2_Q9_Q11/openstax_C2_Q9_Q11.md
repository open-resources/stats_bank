      graph_instructions:
      - The plot should have a main title of 'Birthdays in Each Season'.
      - The x-axis should be labeled 'Proportion (%)'.
      - The y-axis should be labeled 'Season'.
      - The bars should be appropriately labelled.
      - The bars should be colored blue.
      - The bars should have a orange border.
      - The bars should have a density of 10.
      - The plot should be horizontal.
      description: The students in Ms. Ramirezâ€™s math class have birthdays in each
        of the four seasons. The table below shows the four seasons, the number of
        students who have birthdays in each season, and the proportion (%) of students
        in each group. Construct a bar graph showing the percentages.

<pl-card title="Instructions">

Please open the RStudio workspace below and edit the `student.R` script to complete the following task:

Please write R code that generates a barplot with the following properties:

<ul>
{{# params.graph_instructions }}
  <li>{{.}}</li>
{{/ params.graph_instructions }}
</ul>

Note: You should not need to use `ggplot2` for this question, and you are not advised to do so, as it may interfere with the autograder.

Once you are satisfied with the plot your code generates, make sure the script file is saved in RStudio.

To submit your answer after saving it in RStudio, come back to this page and select "Save & Grade" or "Save only" at the bottom of the page.
