        title: Commute Times
      part1:
        ans1:
          value: The distribution is Uniform
          feedback: Correct, good job
        ans2:
          value: The Median of the distribution is about 25 min
          feedback: Correct, good job
        ans3:
          value: The Standard deviation is about 1 min
          feedback: Sorry, this is not a very good estimate of the standard deviation
            try again
        ans4:
          value: The Standard deviation is about 10 min
          feedback: Sorry, this is not a very good estimate of the standard deviation
            try again
        ans5:
          value: The distribution is Bimodal
          feedback: Not quite, what does bi mean in math (look up the definition if
            it is unfamiliar)
        ans6:
          value: The distribution has a median of about 18 min
          feedback: Remember a median is the observation in the middle
      part2:
        ans1:
          value: Since the distribution is already unimodal and symmetric, a log transformation
            is not necessary
          feedback: Correct, good job
        ans2:
          value: Since the distribution is trimodal and left skewed, a log transformation
            would be beneficial to reduce the skewing of the data
          feedback: What does it mean if a graph is left skewed or trimodal?
        ans3:
          value: Since the distribution is already bimodal and right skewed, a log
            transformation is not necessary
          feedback: What does it mean if a graph is right skewed, bimodal, and when
            should you do a log transformation?
        ans4:
          value: Since the distribution is bimodal and left skewed, a log transformation
            would be beneficial to reduce the skewing of the data
          feedback: What does it mean if a graph is left skewed or bimodal?
        ans5:
          value: Since the distribution is already trimodal and left skewed, a log
            transformation is not necessary
          feedback: What does it mean if a graph is left skewed, trimodal, and when
            should you do a log transformation?
        ans6:
          value: Since the distribution is already bimodal and left skewed, a log
            transformation is not necessary
          feedback: What does it mean if a graph is left skewed, bimodal, and when
            should you do a log transformation?

# {{ params.vars.title }}
The US census collects data on time it takes Americans to commute to work, among many other variables.
The histogram below shows the distribution of average commute times in 3,142 US counties in 2010.
Also shown below is a spatial intensity map of the same data.
