  substitutions:
    params_vars_title: Commute Times
    params_part1_ans1_value: The Standard Deviation is about 5 min
    params_part1_ans1_feedback: Correct, good job
    params_part1_ans2_value: The Median of the distribution is about 25 min
    params_part1_ans2_feedback: Correct, good job
    params_part1_ans3_value: The distribution is Bimodal
    params_part1_ans3_feedback: Not quite, what does bi mean in math (look up the
      definition if it is unfamiliar)
    params_part1_ans4_value: The Standard deviation is about 10 min
    params_part1_ans4_feedback: Sorry, this is not a very good estimate of the standard
      deviation try again
    params_part1_ans5_value: The Standard deviation is about 1 min
    params_part1_ans5_feedback: Sorry, this is not a very good estimate of the standard
      deviation try again
    params_part1_ans6_value: The distribution has a median of about 30 min
    params_part1_ans6_feedback: Remember a median is the observation in the middle
    params_part2_ans1_value: Since the distribution is already unimodal and symmetric,
      a log transformation is not necessary
    params_part2_ans1_feedback: Correct, good job
    params_part2_ans2_value: Since the distribution is trimodal and left skewed, a
      log transformation would be beneficial to reduce the skewing of the data
    params_part2_ans2_feedback: What does it mean if a graph is left skewed or trimodal?
    params_part2_ans3_value: Since the distribution is already bimodal and left skewed,
      a log transformation is not necessary
    params_part2_ans3_feedback: What does it mean if a graph is left skewed, bimodal,
      and when should you do a log transformation?
    params_part2_ans4_value: Since the distribution is already bimodal and right skewed,
      a log transformation is not necessary
    params_part2_ans4_feedback: What does it mean if a graph is right skewed, bimodal,
      and when should you do a log transformation?
    params_part2_ans5_value: Since the distribution is bimodal and right skewed, a
      log transformation would be beneficial to reduce the skewing of the data
    params_part2_ans5_feedback: What does it mean if a graph is right skewed or bimodal?
    params_part2_ans6_value: Since the distribution is already trimodal and left skewed,
      a log transformation is not necessary
    params_part2_ans6_feedback: What does it mean if a graph is left skewed, trimodal,
      and when should you do a log transformation?

# {{ params_vars_title }}
The US census collects data on time it takes Americans to commute to work, among many other variables.
The histogram below shows the distribution of average commute times in 3,142 US counties in 2010.
Also shown below is a spatial intensity map of the same data.
