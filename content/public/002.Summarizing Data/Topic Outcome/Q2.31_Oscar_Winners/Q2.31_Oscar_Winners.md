    params_part1_ans1_value: The difference in the peeks of these 2 graphs could suggest
      best actor winners are generally older than best actress winners
    params_part1_ans1_feedback: Correct good job
    params_part1_ans2_value: The best act actress' seem to have a median age of approximately
      40.0 while the best actors seem to have a median age of about 50
    params_part1_ans2_feedback: Correct good job
    params_part1_ans3_value: Both histograms are right skewed
    params_part1_ans3_feedback: Correct good job
    params_part1_ans4_value: There is not enough information to compare the 2 distributions
      in any meaningful way
    params_part1_ans4_feedback: 'False'
    params_part1_ans5_value: The difference in the peeks of these 2 graphs could suggest
      best actor winners are generally younger than best actress winners
    params_part1_ans5_feedback: Nice try, take a closer look at the distributions
    params_part1_ans6_value: The best act actress' seem to have a median age of approximately
      60.0 while the best actors seem to have a median age of about 30
    params_part1_ans6_feedback: not quite, remember the median is the observation
      that is in the middle of the distribution
    params_part1_ans7_value: The actor distribution is symmetric while the actress
      distribution is right skewed
    params_part1_ans7_feedback: Not quite
    params_part1_ans8_value: Both histograms are left skewed
    params_part1_ans8_feedback: Not Quite

# {{ params_vars_title }}
The first Oscar awards for best actor and best actress were given out in 1929. The histograms below show the age distribution for all of the best actor and best actress winners from 1929 to 2018. Summary statistics for these distributions are also provided. Compare the distributions of ages of best actor and actress winners.
