      part1:
        ans1:
          value: Both histograms are right skewed
          feedback: Correct good job
        ans2:
          value: The difference in the peeks of these 2 graphs could suggest best
            actor winners are generally older than best actress winners
          feedback: Correct good job
        ans3:
          value: The best act actress' seem to have a median age of approximately
            40 while the best actors seem to have a median age of about 50.0
          feedback: Correct good job
        ans4:
          value: There is not enough information to compare the 2 distributions in
            any meaningful way
          feedback: 'False'
        ans5:
          value: The similarly in the peeks of these 2 graphs suggest best actor winners
            are generally about the same age as best actress winners
          feedback: Notice the difference in the peeks between the two distributions
        ans6:
          value: The best act actress' seem to have a median age of approximately
            60 while the best actors seem to have a median age of about 30.0
          feedback: not quite, remember the median is the observation that is in the
            middle of the distribution
        ans7:
          value: The actor distribution is symmetric while the actress distribution
            is right skewed
          feedback: Not quite
        ans8:
          value: The actor distribution is left skewed while the actress distribution
            is symmetric
