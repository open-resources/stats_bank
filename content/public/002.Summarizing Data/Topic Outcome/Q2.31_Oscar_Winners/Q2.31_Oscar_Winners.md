          value: The difference in the peeks of these 2 graphs could suggest best
            actor winners are generally older than best actress winners
          feedback: Correct good job
        ans2:
          value: The best act actress' seem to have a median age of approximately
            40.0 while the best actors seem to have a median age of about 50

          value: The similarly in the peeks of these 2 graphs suggest best actor winners
