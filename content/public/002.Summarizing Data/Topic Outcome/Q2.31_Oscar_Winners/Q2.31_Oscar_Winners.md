        ans1:
          value: Both histograms are right skewed
          feedback: Correct good job
        ans2:
          value: The difference in the peeks of these 2 graphs could suggest best
            actor winners are generally older than best actress winners
          feedback: Correct good job
        ans3:
          value: The best act actress' seem to have a median age of approximately
            40.0 while the best actors seem to have a median age of about 50.0
          feedback: Correct good job
        ans4:
          value: There is not enough information to compare the 2 distributions in
            any meaningful way
          feedback: 'False'
        ans5:
          value: The difference in the peeks of these 2 graphs could suggest best
            actor winners are generally younger than best actress winners
          feedback: Nice try, take a closer look at the distributions
        ans6:
          value: The best act actress' seem to have a median age of approximately
            60.0 while the best actors seem to have a median age of about 30.0
          feedback: not quite, remember the median is the observation that is in the
            middle of the distribution
        ans7:
          value: The actor distribution is symmetric while the actress distribution
            is left skewed
