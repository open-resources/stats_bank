    params_part1_ans1_value: Both histograms are right skewed
    params_part1_ans1_feedback: Correct good job
    params_part1_ans2_value: The difference in the peeks of these 2 graphs could suggest
      best actor winners are generally older than best actress winners
    params_part1_ans2_feedback: Correct good job
    params_part1_ans3_value: The best act actress' seem to have a median age of approximately
      40.0 while the best actors seem to have a median age of about 50
    params_part1_ans3_feedback: Correct good job
    params_part1_ans4_value: There is not enough information to compare the 2 distributions
      in any meaningful way
    params_part1_ans4_feedback: 'False'
    params_part1_ans5_value: The similarly in the peeks of these 2 graphs suggest
      best actor winners are generally about the same age as best actress winners
    params_part1_ans5_feedback: Notice the difference in the peeks between the two
      distributions
    params_part1_ans6_value: The best act actress' seem to have a median age of approximately
      50 while the best actors seem to have a median age of about 40.0
    params_part1_ans6_feedback: read carefully
    params_part1_ans7_value: The actor distribution is symmetric while the actress
      distribution is left skewed
    params_part1_ans7_feedback: Not quite

      distribution is symmetric
