        title: TV_Watchers
        ave_time: 4.59
        sd: 5.26
      part1:
        ans1:
          value: No, I would expect the distribution to be right skewed as the number
            of hours spent on TV has a natural boundary at zero and very few people
            watch a tone of TV; also, the standard deviation is quite high in relation
            the mean which further suggests that the data is skewed.
          feedback: Correct good job
        ans2:
          value: Not enough information to tell
          feedback: nice try, but there is enough information here
        ans3:
          value: No, there is not enough information to tell whether the distribution
            is right or left skewed, but the high standard deviation in comparison
            to the mean does indicate that the distribution is not likely symmetric
          feedback: Not quite, but good try
        ans4:
          value: No, I would expect the distribution to be left skewed, there is a
            natural boundary of 24 hours and very few people watch less than a certain
            number of hours of TV each day; also, the standard deviation is quite
            high in relation the mean which further suggests that the data is skewed.
          feedback: 'Note: the default number of hours watched in a day is not 24
            hours, not to mention very few people would have the time to watch lots
            of TV'

# {{ params.vars.title }}
Students in an AP Statistics class were asked how many hours of television they watch per week (including online streaming).
This sample yielded an average of {{params.vars.ave_time}} hours, with a standard deviation of {{params.vars.sd}} hours.

## Part 1

Is the distribution of number of hours students watch television weekly symmetric?
