    params_part1_ans1_value: No, I would expect the distribution to be right skewed
      as the number of hours spent on TV has a natural boundary at zero and very few
      people watch a tone of TV; also, the standard deviation is quite high in relation
      the mean which further suggests that the data is skewed.
    params_part1_ans1_feedback: Correct good job
    params_part1_ans2_value: Not enough information to tell
    params_part1_ans2_feedback: nice try, but there is enough information here
    params_part1_ans3_value: 'Yes: the standard deviation being fairly close in size
      to the mean indicates that this is probably a symmetric distribution'
    params_part1_ans3_feedback: Not quite, try again
    params_part1_ans4_value: No, I would expect the distribution to be left skewed,
      there is a natural boundary of 24 hours and very few people watch less than
      a certain number of hours of TV each day; also, the standard deviation is quite
      high in relation the mean which further suggests that the data is skewed.
    params_part1_ans4_feedback: 'Note: the default number of hours watched in a day
      is not 24 hours, not to mention very few people would have the time to watch
      lots of TV'

# {{ params_vars_title }}
Students in an AP Statistics class were asked how many hours of television they watch per week (including online streaming).
This sample yielded an average of {{params.vars.ave_time}} hours, with a standard deviation of {{params_vars_sd}} hours.

## Part 1

Is the distribution of number of hours students watch television weekly symmetric?
