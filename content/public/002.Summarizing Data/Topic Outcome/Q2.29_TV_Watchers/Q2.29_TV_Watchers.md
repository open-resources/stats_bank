    params_part1_ans1_value: No, I would expect the distribution to be right skewed
      as the number of hours spent on TV has a natural boundary at zero and very few
      people watch a tone of TV; also, the standard deviation is quite high in relation
      the mean which further suggests that the data is skewed.
    params_part1_ans1_feedback: Correct good job
    params_part1_ans2_value: 'Yes: the standard deviation being fairly close in size
      to the mean indicates that this is probably a symmetric distribution'
    params_part1_ans2_feedback: Not quite, try again
    params_part1_ans3_value: Not enough information to tell
    params_part1_ans3_feedback: nice try, but there is enough information here
    params_part1_ans4_value: 'Yes: the natural boundaries at zero and 24, along with
      a relatively manageable standard deviation are strong indicators that this distribution
      is symmetric'
    params_part1_ans4_feedback: Not quite, there is not a good natural boundary at
      24 as no one would default to watching 24 hours of TV in a day

# {{ params_vars_title }}
Students in an AP Statistics class were asked how many hours of television they watch per week (including online streaming).
This sample yielded an average of {{params.vars.ave_time}} hours, with a standard deviation of {{params_vars_sd}} hours.

## Part 1

Is the distribution of number of hours students watch television weekly symmetric?

### Answer Section

- {{ params_part1_ans1_value}}
- {{ params_part1_ans2_value}}
- {{ params_part1_ans3_value}}
- {{ params_part1_ans4_value}}
