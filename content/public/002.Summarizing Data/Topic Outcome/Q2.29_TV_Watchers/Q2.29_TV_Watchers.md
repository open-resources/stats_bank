        title: TV_Watchers
        ave_time: 4.4
        sd: 4.97
      part1:
        ans1:
          value: No, I would expect the distribution to be right skewed as the number
            of hours spent on TV has a natural boundary at zero and very few people
            watch a tone of TV; also, the standard deviation is quite high in relation
            the mean which further suggests that the data is skewed.
          feedback: Correct good job
        ans2:
          value: 'Yes: the natural boundaries at zero and 24, along with a relatively
            manageable standard deviation are strong indicators that this distribution
            is symmetric'
          feedback: Not quite, there is not a good natural boundary at 24 as no one
            would default to watching 24 hours of TV in a day
        ans3:
          value: Not enough information to tell
          feedback: nice try, but there is enough information here
        ans4:
          value: 'Yes: the standard deviation being fairly close in size to the mean
            indicates that this is probably a symmetric distribution'
          feedback: Not quite, try again

# {{ params.vars.title }}
Students in an AP Statistics class were asked how many hours of television they watch per week (including online streaming).
This sample yielded an average of {{params.vars.ave_time}} hours, with a standard deviation of {{params.vars.sd}} hours.

## Part 1

Is the distribution of number of hours students watch television weekly symmetric?
