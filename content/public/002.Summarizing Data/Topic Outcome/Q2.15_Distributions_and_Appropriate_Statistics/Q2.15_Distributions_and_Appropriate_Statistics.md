    params_vars_title: Distributions and Appropriate Statistics
    params_vars_animal: horse
    params_vars_place: the nearest park
    params_vars_thing: pets
    params_vars_Question: a) Would you expect the number of pets per household to
      be symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed?
    params_part1_ans1_value: 'Right skewed: The distribution of number of petss per
      household is likely right skewed as there is a natural boundary at 0 and only
      a few people have many petss.'
    params_part1_ans1_feedback: Correct, awesome work
    params_part1_ans2_value: 'Left skewed: The distribution of number of horses per
      household is likely left skewed as there is a natural boundary at 0 and only
      a few people have many horses.'
    params_part1_ans2_feedback: Not quite, the reasoning here is mostly correct, think
      over what it means for a graph to be left skewed
    params_part1_ans3_value: 'Symmetric skewed: The distribution of number of horses
      per household is likely symmetric as there is a natural boundary at 0 and only
      a few people have many horses.'
    params_part1_ans3_feedback: Not quite, the reasoning here is mostly correct, think
      over what it means for a graph to be symmetric
    params_part2_ans1_value: The mean
    params_part2_ans1_feedback: Not quite, consider the answer to part a)
    params_part2_ans2_value: The median
    params_part2_ans2_feedback: Awesome work
    params_part2_ans3_value: There is not enough information to tell
    params_part2_ans3_feedback: There is enough information this time, consider the
      answer to part a)
    params_part2_ans4_value: 'The force: the force is not with you if you chose this
      one'
    params_part2_ans4_feedback: The force is not with you this day
    params_part3_ans1_value: Standard Deviation
    params_part3_ans1_feedback: Not quite, consider the answer to part b)
    params_part3_ans2_value: IQR
    params_part3_ans2_feedback: Awesome work
    params_part3_ans3_value: There is not enough information to tell
    params_part3_ans3_feedback: There is enough information this time, consider the
      answer to part b)
    params_part3_ans4_value: the second derivative
    params_part3_ans4_feedback: I am afraid that your mind is in calculus my friend
