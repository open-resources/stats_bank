        title: Distributions and Appropriate Statistics
        animal: cat
        place: the nearest hospital
        thing: pets
        Question: a) Would you expect the distance to the nearest hospital, i.e. number
          of miles between the nearest hospital and home to be symmetric, right skewed,
          or left skewed?
      part1:
        ans1:
          value: 'Right skewed: The distribution of number of distance to the nearest
            hospital is likely right skewed as there is a natural boundary at 0 and
            only a few people live a very long distance from the nearest hospital.'
          feedback: Correct, awesome work
        ans2:
          value: 'Left skewed: The distribution of number of distance to the nearest
            hospital is likely left skewed as there is a natural boundary at 0 and
            only a few people live a very long distance from the nearest hospital.'
          feedback: Not quite, the reasoning here is mostly correct, think over what
            it means for a graph to be left skewed
        ans3:
          value: 'Symmetric: The distribution of number of distance to the nearest
            hospital is likely symmetric as there is a natural boundary at 0 and only
            a few people live a very long distance from the nearest hospital.'
          feedback: Not quite, the reasoning here is mostly correct, think over what
            it means for a graph to be symmetric
      part2:
        ans1:
          value: The mean
          feedback: Not quite, consider the answer to part a)
        ans2:
          value: The median
          feedback: Awesome work
        ans3:
          value: There is not enough information to tell
          feedback: There is enough information this time, consider the answer to
            part a)
        ans4:
          value: 'The force: the force is not with you if you chose this one'
          feedback: The force is not with you this day
      part3:
        ans1:
          value: Standard Deviation
          feedback: Not quite, consider the answer to part b)
        ans2:
          value: IQR
          feedback: Awesome work
        ans3:
          value: There is not enough information to tell
          feedback: There is enough information this time, consider the answer to
            part b)
        ans4:
          value: the second derivative
          feedback: I am afraid that your mind is in calculus my friend
