        title: Distributions and Appropriate Statistics
        animal: dog
        place: the nearest hardware store
        thing: pets
        Question: a) Would you expect the heights of adult male dogs to be symmetric,
          right skewed, or left skewed?
      part1:
        ans1:
          value: The distribution of heights of adult male dogs is likely right skewed
          feedback: Not quite, as a hint consider how many tall people there are to
            how many short people there are and are the majority of people of average
            height?
        ans2:
          value: The distribution of heights of adult male dogs is likely left skewed
          feedback: Not quite, as a hint consider how many tall people there are to
            how many short people there are and are the majority of people of average
            height?
        ans3:
          value: The distribution of heights of adult male dogs is likely symmetric
          feedback: Correct, awesome work
      part2:
        ans1:
          value: The mean
          feedback: Awesome work
        ans2:
          value: The median
          feedback: Not quite, consider the answer to part a), note that the data
            is not heavily skewed
        ans3:
          value: There is not enough information to tell
          feedback: There is enough information this time, consider the answer to
            part a)
        ans4:
          value: 'The force: the force is not with you if you chose this one'
          feedback: The force is not with you this day
      part3:
        ans1:
          value: Standard Deviation
          feedback: Awesome Work
        ans2:
          value: IQR
          feedback: Not quite, consider the answer to b)
        ans3:
          value: There is not enough information to tell
          feedback: There is enough information this time, consider the answer to
            part b)
        ans4:
          value: the second derivative
          feedback: I am afraid that your mind is in calculus my friend
