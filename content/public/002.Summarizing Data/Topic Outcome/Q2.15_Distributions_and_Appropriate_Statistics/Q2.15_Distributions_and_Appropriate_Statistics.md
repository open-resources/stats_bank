    params_vars_title: Distributions and Appropriate Statistics
    params_vars_animal: rabbit
    params_vars_place: the nearest grocery store
    params_vars_thing: electronics
    params_vars_Question: a) Would you expect the heights of adult male rabbits to
      be symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed?
    params_part1_ans1_value: The distribution of heights of adult male rabbits is
      likely right skewed
    params_part1_ans1_feedback: Not quite, as a hint consider how many tall people
      there are to how many short people there are and are the majority of people
      of average height?
    params_part1_ans2_value: The distribution of heights of adult male rabbits is
      likely left skewed
    params_part1_ans2_feedback: Not quite, as a hint consider how many tall people
      there are to how many short people there are and are the majority of people
      of average height?
    params_part1_ans3_value: The distribution of heights of adult male rabbits is
      likely symmetric
    params_part1_ans3_feedback: Correct, awesome work
    params_part2_ans1_value: The mean
    params_part2_ans1_feedback: Awesome work
    params_part2_ans2_value: The median
    params_part2_ans2_feedback: Not quite, consider the answer to part a), note that
      the data is not heavily skewed
    params_part2_ans3_value: There is not enough information to tell
    params_part2_ans3_feedback: There is enough information this time, consider the
      answer to part a)
    params_part2_ans4_value: 'The force: the force is not with you if you chose this
      one'
    params_part2_ans4_feedback: The force is not with you this day
    params_part3_ans1_value: Standard Deviation
    params_part3_ans1_feedback: Awesome Work
    params_part3_ans2_value: IQR
    params_part3_ans2_feedback: Not quite, consider the answer to b)
    params_part3_ans3_value: There is not enough information to tell
    params_part3_ans3_feedback: There is enough information this time, consider the
      answer to part b)
    params_part3_ans4_value: the second derivative
    params_part3_ans4_feedback: I am afraid that your mind is in calculus my friend
