        title: Antibiotic use in children
        question: What features are apparent in the pie chart but not in the bar graph?
      part1:
        ans1:
          value: There is nothing visible in the bar graph that is not in the pie
            chart
          feedback: Correct good job
        ans2:
          value: The pie chart shows what the highest relative frequency is
          feedback: This is also visible in the bar graph
        ans3:
          value: We can see the relative frequencies in the pie chart
          feedback: This is not possible in the pie chart
        ans4:
          value: The pie chart is much more visually appealing than the bar graph
          feedback: This is not objective
        ans5:
          value: The pie chart gives a conclusion whereas the bar graph does not
          feedback: Nice try, but the pie chart does not give a conclusion, it is
            only a representation of the data
      part2:
        ans1:
          value: A bar graph is usually a better choice as we can also see the relative
            frequencies of the categories in this graph.
          feedback: Correct good job
        ans2:
          value: They are both equally
          feedback: Not quite consider the answer to part 1
        ans3:
          value: A pie chart is usually a better choice as we can also see the relative
            frequencies of the categories in this graph.
          feedback: Not quite, consider the answer to part 1
        ans4:
          value: I have no idea
          feedback: Being honest is good, but you need to find the answer, take a
            look at part 1 and have a look at the axis labels on the bar chart
        ans5:
          value: There is not enough information to tell
          feedback: Not quite there is enough information, consider your answer to
            part 1
