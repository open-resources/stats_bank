    params_vars_title: Antibiotic use in children
    params_vars_question: What features are apparent in the bar graph but not in the
      pie chart?
    params_part1_ans1_value: ' We see the order of the categories'
    params_part1_ans1_feedback: Correct good job
    params_part1_ans2_value: We can see the relative frequencies in the bar graph
    params_part1_ans2_feedback: Correct good job
    params_part1_ans3_value: The bar graph shows what the highest relative frequency
      is
    params_part1_ans3_feedback: This is also visible in the pie chart
    params_part1_ans4_value: The bar graph gives a conclusion whereas the pie chart
      does not
    params_part1_ans4_feedback: Nice try, but the bar graph does not give a conclusion,
      it is only a representation of the data
    params_part1_ans5_value: The bar graph is much more visually appealing than the
      pie chart
    params_part1_ans5_feedback: this is not objective
    params_part2_ans1_value: A bar graph is usually a better choice as we can also
      see the relative frequencies of the categories in this graph.
    params_part2_ans1_feedback: Correct good job
    params_part2_ans2_value: They are both equally
    params_part2_ans2_feedback: Not quite consider the answer to part 1
    params_part2_ans3_value: A pie chart is usually a better choice as we can also
      see the relative frequencies of the categories in this graph.
    params_part2_ans3_feedback: Not quite, consider the answer to part 1
    params_part2_ans4_value: There is not enough information to tell
    params_part2_ans4_feedback: Not quite there is enough information, consider your
      answer to part 1
    params_part2_ans5_value: I have no idea
    params_part2_ans5_feedback: Being honest is good, but you need to find the answer,
      take a look at part 1 and have a look at the axis labels on the bar chart
