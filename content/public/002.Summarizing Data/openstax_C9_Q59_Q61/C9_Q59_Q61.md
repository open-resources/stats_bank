## Part 1

Assume the null hypothesis states that the mean is {{params.random_test_type}} $${{params.int1}}$$. Is this a left-tailed, right-tailed, or two-tailed test?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans3.value }}

## Part 2

Assume the null hypothesis states that the mean is equal to 88. The alternative hypothesis states that the mean is {{params.selected_direction}} 88. Is this a left-tailed, right-tailed, or two-tailed test?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part2.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans3.value }}
