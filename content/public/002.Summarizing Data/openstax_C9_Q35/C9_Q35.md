        ans1:
          value: The p-value is almost zero, which means we have sufficient evidence
            to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the mean height is less
            than 73.8 inches.
          feedback: You got it!
        ans2:
          value: The p-value is not significant, which means we fail to reject the
            null hypothesis. There is not enough evidence to conclude that the mean
            height is less than 73.8 inches.
          feedback: Try Again!
        ans3:
          value: The p-value is almost zero, which means we have sufficient evidence
            to conclude that the mean height is equal to 73.8 inches.

# {{ params.vars.title }}
It is believed that the mean height of high school students who play basketball on the school team is ${{params.population_mean}}$ inches with a standard deviation of $1.8$ inches. A random sample of $40$ players is chosen. The sample mean was ${{params.sample_mean}}$ inches, and the sample standard deviation was ${{params.sample_std}}$ inches. Do the data support the claim that the mean height is less than ${{params.population_mean}}$ inches at the 5% level?

## Part 1

State the null and alternative hypotheses.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value }}

- {{ params.part1.ans4.value }}

## Part 2

Interpret the p-value.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part2.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans3.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans4.value }}
