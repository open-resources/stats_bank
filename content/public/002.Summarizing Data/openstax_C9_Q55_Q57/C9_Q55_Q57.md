## Part 1

Your friend claims that his mean golf score is $${{params.int1}}$$. You want to show that it is {{params.random_test_type}} than that. What type of test would you use?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans3.value }}

## Part 2

You flip a coin and record whether it shows heads or tails. You know the probability of getting heads is 50%, but you think it is {{params.selected_direction}} for this particular coin. What type of test would you use?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part2.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans2.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans3.value }}
