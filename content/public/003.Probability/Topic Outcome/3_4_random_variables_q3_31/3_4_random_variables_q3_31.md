# {{ params.vars.title }}
<div class="mathjax_ignore">
In a new card game, you start with a well-shuffled full deck and draw {{ params.description.num1 }} cards without replacement. If you draw {{ params.description.num2 }} hearts, you win ${{ params.description.num3 }}. If you draw {{ params.description.num4 }} black cards, you win ${{ params.description.num5 }}. For any other draws, you win nothing.
