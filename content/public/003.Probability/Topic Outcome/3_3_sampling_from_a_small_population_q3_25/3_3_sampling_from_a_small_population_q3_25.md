          feedback: Incorrect. Removing one chip meaningfully changes the probability
            of what might be drawn next.
        ans2:
          value: 'No'
          feedback: Correct!

# {{ params.vars.title }}
Imagine you have a bag containing ${{ params.description.num1 }}$ red, ${{ params.description.num2 }}$ blue, and ${{ params.description.num3 }}$ orange chips.

## Part 1

Suppose you draw a chip and it is blue. If drawing without replacement, what is the probability the next is also blue?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 2

Suppose you draw a chip and it is orange, and then you draw a second chip without replacement. What is the probability this second chip is blue?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 3

If drawing without replacement, what is the probability of drawing two blue chips in a row?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 4

When drawing without replacement, are the draws independent? Explain.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part4.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans2.value }}
