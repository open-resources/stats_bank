      description1: If the proportion of heads is larger than 0.3, you win $1.
      description2: If the proportion of heads is larger than 0.7, you win $1.
      planswer1: 10 tosses. Fewer tosses mean more variability in the sample fraction
        of heads, meaning there's a better chance of getting at least 0.3 heads.
      planswer2: 100 tosses. More flips means the observed proportion of heads would
        often be closer to the average, 0.50, and therefore also above 0.7.

      num2: 100

# {{ params.vars.title }}
Below are four versions of the same game. Your archnemesis gets to pick the version of the game, and then you get to choose how many times to flip a coin: ${{ params.num1 }}$ times or ${{ params.num2 }}$ times. Identify how many coin flips you should choose for each version of the game. It costs ${{ params.num3 }} to play each game.

## Part 1

{{ params.description1 }}

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans2.value }}

## Part 2

{{ params.description2 }}

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part2.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans2.value }}

## Part 3

If the proportion of heads is between ${{ params.part3.num1 }}$ and ${{ params.part3.num2 }}$, you win ${{ params.num3 }}.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part3.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part3.ans2.value }}

## Part 4

If the proportion of heads is smaller than ${{ params.part4.num1 }}$, you win ${{ params.num3 }}.

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part4.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part4.ans2.value }}
