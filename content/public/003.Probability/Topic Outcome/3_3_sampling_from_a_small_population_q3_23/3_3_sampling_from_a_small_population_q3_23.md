Imagine you have an urn containing ${{ params.description.num1 }}$ red, ${{ params.description.num2 }}$ blue, and ${{ params.description.num3 }}$ orange marbles in it.

## Part 1

What is the probability that the first marble you draw is blue?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 2

Suppose you drew a blue marble in the first draw. If drawing with replacement, what is the probability of drawing a blue marble in the second draw?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 3

Suppose you instead drew an orange marble in the first draw. If drawing with replacement, what is the probability of drawing a blue marble in the second draw?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 4

If drawing with replacement, what is the probability of drawing two blue marbles in a row?

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 5

When drawing with replacement, are the draws independent?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part5.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part5.ans2.value }}
