# {{ params.vars.title }}
At a university, ${{ params.description.perc_smokers }}$% of students smoke.

## Part 1

Calculate the expected number of smokers in a random sample of ${{ params.part1.num1 }}$ students from this university.

### Answer Section

Please enter a numeric value in.

## Part 2

The university gym opens at {{ params.part2.start_hour }} am on Saturday mornings. One Saturday morning at {{ params.part2.before_start_hour }}:55 am there are ${{ params.part2.waiting_students }}$ students outside the gym waiting for it to open. Should you use the same approach from part (a) to calculate the expected number of smokers among these ${{ params.part2.waiting_students }}$ students?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part2.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part2.ans2.value }}
