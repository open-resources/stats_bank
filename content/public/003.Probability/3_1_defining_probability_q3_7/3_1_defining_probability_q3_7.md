# {{ params.vars.title }}
A Pew Research survey asked {{ params.description.num1 }} randomly sampled registered voters their political affiliation (Republican, Democrat, or Independent) and whether or not they identify as swing voters. {{ params.description.num22 }}$\%$ of respondents identified as Independent, {{ params.description.num33 }}$\%$ identified as swing voters, and {{ params.description.num44 }}$\%$ identified as both.

## Part 1

Are being Independent and being a swing voter disjoint, i.e. mutually exclusive?

### Answer Section

- {{ params.part1.ans1.value }}
- {{ params.part1.ans2.value }}

## Part 2

Select the values that make the Venn diagram below correctly summarize the variables and their associated probabilities.
